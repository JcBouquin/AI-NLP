Collaborative research
Our experience is that many researchers work independently to produce code for data processing and
"analysis. We seek to move towards a more collaborative,
iterative, and self-checking development process"
"where
researchers work
together
on a
shared code
base. To
facilitate
collaboration,
a public
code"
"repository has been created to encourage
researchers
to develop and share
code
collectively: https://"
github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code.
"The repository has been seeded with code to calculate commonly utilized variables
in critical care"
"research,
including severity of illness scores, comorbidity scores, and duration of various treatments such"
as mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use. We encourage users to incorporate this code into their
"research, provide improvements, and add new contributions that have potential
to beneﬁt
the research"
"community as a whole. Over time, we expect
the repository to become increasingly vital
for researchers"
working with the MIMIC-III database.
"Alongside work on the centralized codebase, we support efforts to transform MIMIC into common"
"data models
such the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model
(OMOP-"
"these
common models may help
to
facilitate
integration with complementary

datasets and to enable the application of generalized analytic tools. Important efforts to map concepts to
standardized clinical ontologies are also underway.
