Patient characteristics
"MIMIC-III
contains
data
associated with
53,423
distinct
hospital
admissions
for
adult
patients"
"(aged
16
years
or
above)
admitted
to
critical
care
units
between
2001
and
2012.
In
addition,
it"
"contains data
for 7870 neonates
admitted between 2001 and 2008. The data
covers 38,597 distinct"
"adult
patients
and
49,785
hospital
admissions.
The median
age
of
adult
patients
is
65.8
years"
"(Q1–Q3: 52.8–77.8), 55.9% patients are male, and in-hospital mortality is 11.5%. The median length of an"
"ICU stay is 2.1 days
(Q1–Q3: 1.2–4.6) and the median length of a hospital
stay is 6.9 days
(Q1-Q3:"
"4.1–11.9). A mean
of
4579
charted
observations
(’chartevents’)
and
380
laboratory measurements"
"(’labevents’)
are
available
for
each hospital
admission. Table
1 provides
a
breakdown of
the
adult"
population by care unit.
"The primary
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases
(ICD-9)
codes
from the patient
discharges"
"are
listed in Table 2. The
top three
codes across hospital admissions
for patients aged 16 years and"
above were:
"● 414.01
(‘Coronary
atherosclerosis of native
coronary
artery’),
accounting
for
7.1% of
all hospital"
admissions;
"● 038.9 (‘Unspeciﬁed septicemia’), accounting for 4.2% of all hospital admissions; and"
"● 410.71
(‘Subendocardial
infarction,
initial
episode
of
care’),
accounting
for
3.6% of
all
hospital"
admissions.
Classes of data
"Data
available
in
the MIMIC-III
database
ranges
from time-stamped,
nurse-veriﬁed
physiological"
"measurements made
at
the
bedside
to free-text
interpretations
of
imaging
studies provided by
the"
radiology department. Table 3 gives an overview of the different classes of data available. Figure 2 shows
"sample data for a single patient stay in a medical
intensive care unit. The patient, who was undergoing a"
"course of
chemotherapy
at
the
time of
admission, presented with febrile neutropenia,
anemia,
and"
thrombocytopenia.
Methods
"The
Laboratory
for
Computational
Physiology
at Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
is
an"
"interdisciplinary team of data scientists and practicing physicians. MIMIC-III
is
the third iteration of"
"the MIMIC critical
care database,
enabling us
to draw upon prior
experience with regard to data"
management and integration3.
Database development
"The MIMIC-III database was populated with data that had been acquired during routine hospital care, so"
"there was no
associated
burden on caregivers
and no
interference with their workﬂow. Data was"
"downloaded from several sources,
including:"
● archives from critical care information systems.
● hospital electronic health record databases.
● Social Security Administration Death Master File.
