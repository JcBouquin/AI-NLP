Background & Summary
In recent years there has been a concerted move towards the adoption of digital health record systems in
"hospitals.
In the US,
for
example,
the number of non-federal
acute
care hospitals with basic digital"
systems increased from 9.4 to 75.5% over the 7 year period between 2008 and 2014 (ref. 1).
"Despite this advance, interoperability of digital systems remains an open issue,
leading to challenges in"
"data
integration. As
a
result,
the potential
that hospital data offers
in terms of understanding
and"
"improving care is yet
to be fully realized.
In parallel,
the scientiﬁc research community is
increasingly"
coming under criticism for the lack of reproducibility of studies2.
"Here we
report
the
release of
the MIMIC-III database,
an update
to the widely-used MIMIC-II"
"database (Data Citation 1). MIMIC-III
integrates deidentiﬁed, comprehensive clinical data of patients"
"admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
in Boston, Massachusetts, and makes
it widely"
accessible to researchers internationally under a data use agreement (Fig. 1). The open nature of the data
allows clinical studies to be reproduced and improved in ways that would not otherwise be possible.
"Based on our experience with the previous major release of MIMIC (MIMIC-II, released in 2010) we"
"anticipate MIMIC-III to be widely used internationally in areas such as academic and industrial research,"
"quality improvement
initiatives, and higher education coursework."
"To
recognize
the
increasingly
broad
usage
of MIMIC, we
have
renamed
the
full
title
of
the"
"database from ‘Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care’
to ‘Medical
Information Mart"
for Intensive Care’. The MIMIC-III critical care database is unique and notable for the following reasons:
"● it
is the only freely accessible critical care database of
its kind;"
"● the dataset spans more than a decade, with detailed information about
individual patient care;"
"● analysis is unrestricted once a data use agreement is accepted, enabling clinical research and education"
around the world.
