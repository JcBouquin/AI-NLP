,"Figure 2.
Sample data for a single patient stay in a medical
intensive care unit. GCS is Glasgow Coma Scale;"
,NIBP is non-invasive blood pressure; and O2 saturation is blood oxygen saturation.
,"Metavision
system are
stored
in INPUTEVENTS_MV. Additional
information was
collected
from"
,"hospital and laboratory health record systems,
including:"
,● patient demographics and in-hospital mortality.
,"● laboratory test results (for example, hematology, chemistry, and microbiology results)."
,● discharge summaries and reports of electrocardiogram and imaging studies.
,"● billing-related information such as International Classiﬁcation of Disease, 9th Edition (ICD-9) codes,"
,"Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes."
,Out-of-hospital mortality dates were obtained using the Social Security Administration Death Master
,File. A more detailed description of the data is shown in Table 1. Physiological waveforms obtained from
,"bedside monitors
(such
as
electrocardiograms,
blood
pressure waveforms,
photoplethysmograms,"
,impedance pneumograms) were obtained for a subset of patients.
,Several projects are ongoing to map concepts within the MIMIC database to standardized dictionaries.
,"For example, researchers at the National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health have mapped"
,"laboratory tests and medications
in MIMIC-II
to LOINC and RxNorm,
respectively4. Efforts are also"
,"underway to transform MIMIC to common data models, such as the Observational Medical Outcomes"
,"Partnership Common Data Model, to support the application of standardized tools and methods5. These"
,developments are progressively incorporated into the MIMIC database where possible.
,The project was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
,"(Boston, MA)
and
the Massachusetts
Institute
of Technology
(Cambridge, MA). Requirement
for"
,"individual patient consent was waived because the project did not
impact clinical care and all protected"
,health information was deidentiﬁed.
