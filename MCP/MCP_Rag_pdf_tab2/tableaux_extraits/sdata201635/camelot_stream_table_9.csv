Deidentiﬁcation
"Before data was incorporated into the MIMIC-III database,
it was ﬁrst deidentiﬁed in accordance with"
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards using structured data cleansing
and date shifting. The deidentiﬁcation process for structured data required the removal of all eighteen of
"the identifying data elements listed in HIPAA,
including ﬁelds such as patient name, telephone number,"
"address, and dates. In particular, dates were shifted into the future by a random offset for each individual"
"patient in a consistent manner to preserve intervals, resulting in stays which occur sometime between the"
"years 2100 and 2200. Time of day, day of the week, and approximate seasonality were conserved during"
date shifting. Dates of birth for patients aged over 89 were shifted to obscure their true age and comply
"with HIPAA regulations:
these patients appear in the database with ages of over 300 years."
"Protected health information was
removed from free
text ﬁelds,
such as diagnostic
reports
and"
"physician notes, using
a
rigorously
evaluated deidentiﬁcation system based on extensive dictionary"
"look-ups
and
pattern-matching with regular
expressions6. The
components
of
this
deidentiﬁcation"
system are continually expanded as new data is acquired.
Code availability
The code that underpins the MIMIC-III website and documentation is openly available and contributions
from the research community are encouraged: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-website
A Jupyter Notebook containing the code used to generate the tables and descriptive statistics included
in this paper is available at: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-iii-paper/
Data Records
"MIMIC-III
is
a
relational database
consisting of
26
tables
(Data Citation 1). Tables
are
linked by"
"identiﬁers which usually have
the
sufﬁx ‘ID’. For
example, SUBJECT_ID refers
to a unique patient,"
"HADM_ID refers to a unique admission to the hospital, and ICUSTAY_ID refers to a unique admission"
to an intensive care unit.
"Charted events such as notes,
laboratory tests, and ﬂuid balance are stored in a series of ‘events’ tables."
"For example the OUTPUTEVENTS table contains all measurements related to output for a given patient,"
while the LABEVENTS table contains laboratory test results for a patient.
"Tables preﬁxed with ‘D_’ are dictionary tables and provide deﬁnitions
for
identiﬁers. For example,"
"every
row of CHARTEVENTS
is
associated with
a
single
ITEMID which
represents
the
concept"
"measured, but it does not contain the actual name of the measurement. By joining CHARTEVENTS and"
"D_ITEMS on ITEMID,
it
is possible to identify the concept
represented by a given ITEMID. Further"
"detail
is provided below."
Data tables
"Developing the MIMIC data model
involved balancing simplicity of
interpretation against closeness to"
"ground truth. As such, the model is a reﬂection of underlying data sources, modiﬁed over iterations of the"
MIMIC database in response to user feedback. Table 4 describes how data is distributed across the data
"tables. Care has been taken to avoid making assumptions about
the underlying data when carrying out"
"transformations, so MIMIC-III closely represents the raw hospital data."
"Broadly speaking, ﬁve tables are used to deﬁne and track patient
stays: ADMISSIONS; PATIENTS;"
"ICUSTAYS;
SERVICES;
and TRANSFERS. Another ﬁve
tables
are dictionaries
for
cross-referencing"
"codes
against
their
respective
deﬁnitions: D_CPT; D_ICD_DIAGNOSES; D_ICD_PROCEDURES;"
"D_ITEMS; and D_LABITEMS. The remaining tables contain data associated with patient care, such as"
"physiological measurements, caregiver observations, and billing information."
"In some cases
it would be possible to merge tables—for example,
the D_ICD_PROCEDURES and"
"CPTEVENTS
tables
both
contain
detail
relating
to
procedures
and
could
be
combined—but
our"
"approach is to keep the tables independent
for clarity, since the data sources are signiﬁcantly different."
"Rather than combining the tables within MIMIC data model, we suggest researchers develop database"
views and transforms as appropriate.
Technical Validation
"The number of
structural changes were minimized to achieve the desired level of deidentiﬁcation and"
"data schema, helping to ensure that MIMIC-III closely represents the raw data collected within the Beth"
Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
"Best practice for
scientiﬁc computing was followed where possible7. Code used to build MIMIC-III"
was version controlled and developed collaboratively within the laboratory. This approach encouraged
"and facilitated sharing of readable code and documentation, as well as frequent feedback from colleagues."
"Issue tracking is used to ensure that
limitations of
the data and code are clearly documented and"
are dealt with as appropriate. The research community is encouraged to report and address issues as they
"are found, and a system for releasing minor database updates is in place."
