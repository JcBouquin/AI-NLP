=== QUESTION ===

How would you calculate the trajectory of a projectile fired at a 45-degree angle with an initial velocity of 20 m/s?

=== FINAL ANSWER (STEP 4) ===

The trajectory of the projectile fired at a 45-degree angle with an initial velocity of 20 m/s results in a range of approximately 40.65 meters, a maximum height of approximately 10.1 meters, and a total time of flight of approximately 2.88 seconds.

Step 1: High-level concepts and principles:
To calculate the trajectory of a projectile, we need to consider the following key concepts:
- Projectile motion: This is a form of motion experienced by an object or particle that is thrown near the earth's surface and moves along a curved path under the influence of gravity.
- Kinematic equations: These equations describe the motion of objects and relate displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.
- Components of motion: The initial velocity can be broken down into horizontal and vertical components, especially when the projectile is launched at an angle.

Step 2: Application of these concepts:
In this specific problem, we are dealing with a projectile launched at a 45-degree angle with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. The angle of launch allows us to use trigonometric functions to find the horizontal (vx) and vertical (vy) components of the initial velocity:
- The horizontal component (vx) can be calculated as: 
  \( vx = v_0 \cdot \cos(\theta) \)
- The vertical component (vy) can be calculated as: 
  \( vy = v_0 \cdot \sin(\theta) \)
Where \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity and \( \theta \) is the launch angle.

Step 3: Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Calculate the horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity:
   - Given \( v_0 = 20 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \theta = 45^\circ \):
   - \( vx = 20 \cdot \cos(45^\circ) = 20 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 14.14 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - \( vy = 20 \cdot \sin(45^\circ) = 20 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 14.14 \, \text{m/s} \)

2. Determine the time of flight (T):
   - The time of flight can be calculated using the formula:
   \( T = \frac{2 \cdot vy}{g} \)
   - Where \( g \) (acceleration due to gravity) is approximately \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):
   - \( T = \frac{2 \cdot 14.14}{9.81} \approx 2.88 \, \text{s} \)

3. Calculate the range (R) of the projectile:
   - The range can be calculated using the formula:
   \( R = vx \cdot T \)
   - \( R = 14.14 \cdot 2.88 \approx 40.65 \, \text{m} \)

4. Determine the maximum height (H):
   - The maximum height can be calculated using the formula:
   \( H = \frac{vy^2}{2g} \)
   - \( H = \frac{(14.14)^2}{2 \cdot 9.81} \approx 10.1 \, \text{m} \)

Step 4: The trajectory of the projectile fired at a 45-degree angle with an initial velocity of 20 m/s results in a range of approximately 40.65 meters, a maximum height of approximately 10.1 meters, and a total time of flight of approximately 2.88 seconds.
