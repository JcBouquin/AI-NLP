=== QUESTION ===

If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then slows to 40 mph for 1 hour, what is the average speed for the journey?

=== FINAL SOLUTION (STEP 4) ===

Final Solution  
The average speed for the journey is approximately 53.33 mph. This is calculated by dividing the total distance of 160 miles by the total time of 3 hours.

Step 1: Generate Zero-Shot CoT  
Let's think step by step. To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance for that part is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles. Then, it slows to 40 mph for 1 hour, covering an additional distance of 40 mph * 1 hour = 40 miles. The total distance is 120 miles + 40 miles = 160 miles. The total time is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours. Finally, the average speed is total distance divided by total time, which is 160 miles / 3 hours = approximately 53.33 mph.

Step 2: Construct Few-Shot CoT Prompt  
Example 1:  
Q: A car travels at 50 mph for 3 hours and then at 30 mph for 2 hours. What is the average speed for the journey?  
A: Let's think step by step. The car travels 50 mph * 3 hours = 150 miles in the first part. Then, it travels 30 mph * 2 hours = 60 miles in the second part. The total distance is 150 miles + 60 miles = 210 miles. The total time is 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours. The average speed is 210 miles / 5 hours = 42 mph.

Example 2:  
Q: A cyclist rides at 15 mph for 4 hours and then at 10 mph for 1 hour. What is the average speed for the journey?  
A: Let's think step by step. The cyclist travels 15 mph * 4 hours = 60 miles in the first part. Then, they travel 10 mph * 1 hour = 10 miles in the second part. The total distance is 60 miles + 10 miles = 70 miles. The total time is 4 hours + 1 hour = 5 hours. The average speed is 70 miles / 5 hours = 14 mph.

Q: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then slows to 40 mph for 1 hour, what is the average speed for the journey?  
A: 

Step 3: Solve with Few-Shot CoT  
Let's think step by step. The train travels 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles in the first part. Then, it travels 40 mph * 1 hour = 40 miles in the second part. The total distance is 120 miles + 40 miles = 160 miles. The total time is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours. The average speed is 160 miles / 3 hours = approximately 53.33 mph.

Step 4: Final Solution  
The average speed for the journey is approximately 53.33 mph. This is calculated by dividing the total distance of 160 miles by the total time of 3 hours.
