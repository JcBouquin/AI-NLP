    "# Step-Back Prompting: A Strategic Approach to Strengthen LLM Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-Back Prompting, introduced by Zheng et al. (2023c), is an innovative method that modifies the classic Chain-of-Thought reasoning approach by adding an essential preliminary phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does Step-Back Prompting Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a mathematician faced with a complex problem. Before diving into detailed calculations, they would first take a step back to identify general concepts and relevant theoretical principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-Back Prompting reproduces this intellectual approach in two distinct phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generic preliminary question**: Before addressing the specific problem, the LLM is asked to reflect on high-level concepts, general principles, or fundamental facts related to the problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Detailed reasoning**: Only after this conceptual contextualization step does the model engage in detailed reasoning to solve the specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Is This So Effective?\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach offers considerable advantages by allowing the model to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Activate relevant knowledge before applying it\n",
    "* Establish a solid conceptual framework to guide reasoning\n",
    "* Avoid errors due to an overly direct and hasty approach\n",
    "* Break down complex problems into theoretical and then practical components\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are particularly impressive in:\n",
    "* Mathematical reasoning problems\n",
    "* Complex scientific questions\n",
    "* Problems requiring the application of abstract principles to concrete cases\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like teaching a student to take the time to understand the theory before tackling exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method has demonstrated significant improvements on several reasoning benchmarks for both PaLM2L and GPT-4 models, confirming its robustness and effectiveness across different LLM architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next time you ask an AI a complex question, try inviting it to first reflect on relevant general concepts before asking for the specific answer!"

    "    Step-Back Prompting is a modification of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) where the LLM is first asked to consider high-level concepts or principles before delving into detailed reasoning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This technique significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks by encouraging the model to first understand the broader context and applicable principles before addressing specific details.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Step-Back process includes the following steps:\n",
    "    1. High-level abstraction: First, identify the general principles, concepts, or frameworks that are relevant to the question.\n",
    "    2. Conceptual analysis: Explore how these high-level concepts apply to the specific problem.\n",
    "    3. Detailed reasoning: Once the conceptual framework is established, work through the specific problem step by step.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Step 1: High-level concepts and principles:\n",
    "    Before diving into calculations, let me consider the key concepts involved in this problem:\n",
    "    - Percentage discounts: When an item is discounted by X%, we multiply the price by (100%-X%) or (1-X/100)\n",
    "    - Sales tax: Tax is applied after discounts, and we add X% tax by multiplying by (100%+X%) or (1+X/100)\n",
    "    - Order of operations: In retail pricing, discounts are applied first, then tax is calculated on the discounted amount\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 2: Application of these concepts:\n",
    "    For this specific problem:\n",
    "    - We need to apply a 25% discount to the original price of $80\n",
    "    - Then we need to apply a 7% sales tax to the discounted price\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 3: Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
    "    1. Calculate the discounted price:\n",
    "       - Original price = $80\n",
    "       - Discount rate = 25% = 0.25\n",
    "       - Discount amount = $80 × 0.25 = $20\n",
    "       - Discounted price = $80 - $20 = $60\n",
    "       - Alternatively: Discounted price = $80 × (1 - 0.25) = $80 × 0.75 = $60\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Calculate the tax on the discounted price:\n",
    "       - Discounted price = $60\n",
    "       - Tax rate = 7% = 0.07\n",
    "       - Tax amount = $60 × 0.07 = $4.20\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Calculate the final price:\n",
    "       - Final price = Discounted price + Tax amount\n",
    "       - Final price = $60 + $4.20 = $64.20\n",
    "    \n",

    "- Physics problems requiring application of fundamental laws\n",

    "- Environmental science questions requiring multi-disciplinary understanding\n",

    "- Applied mathematics problems in real-world contexts\n",
    "- Probability and statistics questions requiring conceptual clarity first\n",

    "### Conceptual Analysis\n",
    "- Philosophical questions requiring definitional clarity\n",
    "- Questions involving ethical frameworks or principles\n",
    "- Policy analysis requiring understanding of underlying theories\n",
    "- Technical questions that benefit from domain knowledge\n",

    "### Concrete Examples of Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"How would you calculate the trajectory of a projectile fired at a 45-degree angle with an initial velocity of 20 m/s?\"\n",
    "   - Step-back would first explore concepts of projectile motion, gravity, and kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"What would be the most appropriate statistical test to determine if there's a significant difference between these two treatment groups?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "3. \"How would you design a sustainable urban transportation system that reduces carbon emissions by 50%?\"\n",
    "   - Step-back would explore transportation system principles, sustainability concepts, and emission factors\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"What would be the environmental impact of replacing 30% of beef consumption with plant-based alternatives?\"\n",
    "   - Step-back would establish concepts of carbon footprints, land use, agricultural systems, and nutritional requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"How should we approach the ethical question of data privacy in AI-driven healthcare systems?\"\n",
    "   - Step-back would first explore broader principles of medical ethics, data ownership, and stakeholder interests\n",
