voici un prompt concernant la technique de prompt suivante Active Prompting dont voici la 
definition scientifique 

Active Prompting (Diao et al., 2023) starts with
some training questions/exemplars, asks the LLM
to solve them, then calculates uncertainty (disagreement in this case) and asks human annotators to
rewrite the exemplars with highest uncertainty.

cette technique appartient à la famille des  Few-Shot CoT 
dont voici la definition 

This set of techniques presents the LLM with multiple exemplars, which include chains-of-thought.
This can significantly enhance performance. This
technique is occasionally referred to as ManualCoT (Zhang et al., 2022b) or Golden CoT (Del and
Fishel, 2023).

elle meme appartenant à la famille plus générale des Chains Of Thought (CoT) dont voici la definition générale 

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting (Wei et al.,
2022b) leverages few-shot prompting to encourage the LLM to express its thought process before
delivering its final answer.6 This technique is occasionally referred to as Chain-of-Thoughts (Tutunov
et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023d).
It has been demonstrated to significantly enhance
the LLM’s performance in mathematics and reasoning tasks. In Wei et al. (2022b), the prompt includes
an exemplar featuring a question, a reasoning path,
and the correct answer (Figure 2.8).

    Generate Active Prompting examples based on user questions.
    
    Active Prompting is a specialized technique within Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting that:
    1. Starts with training questions/exemplars
    2. Asks the LLM to solve these exemplars
    3. Calculates uncertainty (disagreement in responses)
    4. Identifies exemplars with highest uncertainty
    5. Uses human annotators to rewrite these high-uncertainty exemplars
    6. Iteratively improves prompting quality through this feedback loop
    
    This approach enhances LLM performance by focusing human effort on the most challenging examples.
    
    Please structure your response in the following format:
    
    Step 1: Initial Exemplars
    [Provide 3-5 exemplars with questions and CoT reasoning]
    
    Step 2: First Iteration
    [LLM-generated solutions to the exemplars]
    
    Step 3: Uncertainty Analysis
    [Identify which exemplars have highest uncertainty/disagreement]
    
    Step 4: Refined Exemplars
    [Rewritten versions of high-uncertainty exemplars with clearer reasoning chains]
    
    Step 5: Final Solution
    [Improved answer to the original question using insights from the refined exemplars]
    
    Example:
    Question: "What would be the total cost of buying 3 shirts at $24.99 each and 2 pairs of pants at $39.95 each, with an 8% sales tax?"
    
    Initial Exemplars:
    Exemplar 1: 
    Q: If a book costs $12.50 and I have a 20% off coupon, how much will I pay?
    A: To find the discounted price, I need to calculate 20% of $12.50 and subtract it from the original price.
    20% of $12.50 = 0.20 × $12.50 = $2.50
    Final price = $12.50 - $2.50 = $10.00
    Therefore, I will pay $10.00 for the book.
    
    Exemplar 2:
    Q: What is the total cost of 4 apples at $0.75 each and 3 oranges at $0.60 each?
    A: First, I'll calculate the cost of the apples.
    Cost of apples = 4 × $0.75 = $3.00
    Next, I'll calculate the cost of the oranges.
    Cost of oranges = 3 × $0.60 = $1.80
    Total cost = $3.00 + $1.80 = $4.80
    Therefore, the total cost is $4.80.
    
    Exemplar 3:
    Q: If a meal costs $45.00 and I want to leave a 15% tip, what will my total bill be?
    A: To find the tip amount, I calculate 15% of the meal cost.
    Tip amount = 0.15 × $45.00 = $6.75
    Total bill = Meal cost + Tip = $45.00 + $6.75 = $51.75
    Therefore, my total bill will be $51.75.
    
    First Iteration:
    For our question about shirts and pants:
    Cost of shirts = 3 × $24.99 = $74.97
    Cost of pants = 2 × $39.95 = $79.90
    Subtotal = $74.97 + $79.90 = $154.87
    Tax amount = 0.08 × $154.87 = $12.39
    Total cost = $154.87 + $12.39 = $167.26
    
    Uncertainty Analysis:
    The calculation seems straightforward, but there might be uncertainty in how to handle the cents in the multiplication and whether to round the tax amount. 
     Let's identify this as an area of potential disagreement.
    
    Refined Exemplars:
    Exemplar 2 (Rewritten):
    Q: What is the total cost of 4 apples at $0.75 each and 3 oranges at $0.60 each?
    A: First, I'll calculate the cost of the apples.
    Cost of apples = 4 × $0.75 = $3.00
    Next, I'll calculate the cost of the oranges.
    Cost of oranges = 3 × $0.60 = $1.80
    Subtotal = $3.00 + $1.80 = $4.80
    For retail transactions, we calculate to the nearest cent, so the total cost is exactly $4.80.
    
    Exemplar 3 (Rewritten):
    Q: If a meal costs $45.00 and I want to leave a 15% tip, what will my total bill be?
    A: To find the tip amount, I calculate 15% of the meal cost.
    Tip amount = 0.15 × $45.00 = $6.75
    Total bill = Meal cost + Tip = $45.00 + $6.75 = $51.75
    When calculating percentages, we typically round to the nearest cent, so the total bill is $51.75.
    
    Final Solution:
    To find the total cost of buying 3 shirts and 2 pairs of pants with sales tax:
    
    Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shirts.
    Cost of shirts = 3 × $24.99 = $74.97
    
    Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pants.
    Cost of pants = 2 × $39.95 = $79.90
    
    Step 3: Determine the subtotal before tax.
    Subtotal = $74.97 + $79.90 = $154.87
    
    Step 4: Calculate the sales tax amount.
    Tax amount = 0.08 × $154.87 = $12.3896
    Rounded to the nearest cent: $12.39
    
    Step 5: Compute the final total.
    Total cost = $154.87 + $12.39 = $167.26
    
    Therefore, the total cost would be $167.26.

premiere question est il bien représentatif selon toi de la technique de prompt Active Prompting


parfait alors maintenant j'aimerais que tu m'adaptes le meme type de prompt mais pour la technique de prompte suivante 

Self-Generated In-Context Learning (SG-ICL)
(Kim et al., 2022) leverages a GenAI to automatically generate exemplars. While better than zeroshot scenarios when training data is unavailable,
the generated samples are not as effective as actual
data.

seulement attention !! 

cette tecnique n'est plus référérencé comme appartenant au CoT et encore moins au Few Shot Cot 

cette technique appartient à la famille dite Few-Shot Prompting Techniques dont voici un rappel de la definition 

Considering all of these factors, Few-Shot Prompting can be very difficult to implement effectively.
We now examine techniques for Few-Shot Prompting in the supervised setting. Ensembling approaches can also benefit Few-Shot Prompting, but
we discuss them separately (Section 2.2.4).
Assume we have a training dataset, Dtrain
,
which contains multiple inputs Dtrain
xi and outputs
Dtrain
y
i
, which can be used to few-shot prompt a
GenAI (rather than performing gradient-based updates). Assume that this prompt can be dynamically

peux tu donc en t'inspirant du prompt de l'active prompt me faire un prompt d'expert de  :
