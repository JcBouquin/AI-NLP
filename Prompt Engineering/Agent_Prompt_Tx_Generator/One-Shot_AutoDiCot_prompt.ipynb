    "# One-Shot AutoDiCot + Full Context\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Shot AutoDiCot + Full Context, explored by prompt engineers, is an adaptive technique that enhances language model (LLM) performance by identifying and correcting specific misclassifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does One-Shot AutoDiCot + Full Context Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're coaching a talented student who occasionally misunderstands certain problem types. Instead of revamping your entire teaching approach, you could be more efficient by pinpointing those specific misconceptions and addressing them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Shot AutoDiCot + Full Context follows this logic in three key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Identification**: After performing 10-shot prompting, a specific instance (like the 12th item in the development set) that's being incorrectly classified is identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explanation Generation**: The LLM is prompted to generate an explanation of why this mislabeling occurred, revealing potential reasoning flaws or biases in how the model interprets the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Targeted Refinement**: Based on this explanation, the prompt is carefully modified to correct the specific error while maintaining performance on other examples. This might involve adding clarifying examples or emphasizing overlooked features relevant to the classification."

    "# Most Suitable Questions for One-Shot AutoDiCot + Full Context\n",
    "\n",
    "For One-Shot AutoDiCot + Full Context, the most suitable questions are those where identifying and correcting specific misclassifications can significantly enhance model performance. Here are types of questions that would be particularly well-suited to this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Tasks with Edge Cases\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis with mixed or subtle emotions\n",
    "- Spam detection with legitimate-looking marketing content\n",
    "- Toxicity classification with cultural nuances\n",
    "- Topic categorization with overlapping themes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contextual Misinterpretation Scenarios\n",
    "- Intent classification with ambiguous phrasing\n",
    "- Sarcasm or irony detection in text\n",
    "- Emergency vs. non-emergency identification in messages\n",
    "- Professional vs. casual language classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Recognition Challenges\n",
    "- Questions where conflicting signal words appear\n",
    "- Classification tasks with misleading features\n",
    "- Cases where exceptions to general rules apply\n",
    "- Scenarios where word order significantly alters meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concrete Examples of Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Classify whether this text expresses positive or negative sentiment: 'The movie was surprisingly boring but the soundtrack was excellent.'\"\n",
    "   - Contains mixed signals that might confuse classification\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Determine if this email is spam: 'Important notification: Your recent order has been processed. Click here to view shipping details.'\"\n",
    "   - Contains legitimate-looking content with potential spam indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Categorize this news headline as factual reporting or opinion: 'Studies suggest economy may face challenges in coming months'\"\n",
    "   - Contains qualifying language that makes classification challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"Classify this customer feedback as a complaint or suggestion: 'Your product would be better if it had the features your competitors offer'\"\n",
    "   - Indirect criticism that could be misclassified\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"Identify whether this social media post contains misinformation: 'Scientists have different theories about the optimal diet for weight loss'\"\n",
    "   - Contains truthful statements that could be misinterpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Shot AutoDiCot + Full Context is particularly effective for these types of questions because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It identifies specific instances where misclassification occurs rather than general patterns\n",
    "- It generates explanations for why the misclassification happened, revealing model reasoning flaws\n",
    "- It allows for targeted prompt modifications to address specific error cases\n",
    "- It improves performance by focusing on challenging edge cases while maintaining accuracy on clearer examples\n",
    "- It provides insight into model reasoning processes that can inform broader prompt engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is especially valuable in classification contexts where subtle features or conflicting signals can lead to misclassifications, and where understanding the specific reasoning failures can lead to more robust prompt design."
