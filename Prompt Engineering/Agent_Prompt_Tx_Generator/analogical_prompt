Step 1: Analogous problem identification:
This problem involves determining the total number of matches played in a single-elimination tournament. A similar problem could be: "In a single-elimination tournament with 8 teams, how many matches will be played in total?"

Step 2: Solution of the analogous problem:
To solve this analogous problem:
1. In a single-elimination tournament, each match eliminates one team. Therefore, to determine the number of matches, we can note that all but one team must be eliminated to declare a winner.
2. For 8 teams, we need to eliminate 7 teams (since 8 - 1 = 7). Thus, there will be 7 matches played.

Step 3: Transfer of solution strategy:
Now I can apply the same strategy to our original problem about the tournament with 64 teams:
1. In a single-elimination tournament with 64 teams, we need to eliminate 63 teams (since 64 - 1 = 63). Therefore, there will be 63 matches played.

Step 4: The total number of matches played in the tournament with 64 teams is 63.
