=== QUESTION ===

If a factory produces widgets at a rate of 800 per day with 5% defective, and each widget costs $3 to make and sells for $8, what is the expected daily profit after accounting for defects?

=== FINAL SOLUTION ===

The expected daily profit after accounting for defects is $3680. This was determined by calculating the total revenue from non-defective widgets and subtracting the total production cost.

Step 1: Generate Multiple CoT Reasoning Paths

Path 1:
1. The factory produces 800 widgets per day.
2. The defect rate is 5%, so the number of defective widgets = 800 * 0.05 = 40.
3. The number of non-defective widgets = 800 - 40 = 760.
4. The cost to make each widget is $3, so total cost = 800 * $3 = $2400.
5. The selling price for each widget is $8, so total revenue from non-defective widgets = 760 * $8 = $6080.
6. Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $6080 - $2400 = $3680.
Answer: $3680.

Path 2:
1. Total production = 800 widgets.
2. Defective widgets = 5% of 800 = 40.
3. Non-defective widgets = 800 - 40 = 760.
4. Cost of production = 800 * $3 = $2400.
5. Revenue from selling non-defective widgets = 760 * $8 = $6080.
6. Profit = Revenue - Cost = $6080 - $2400 = $3680.
Answer: $3680.

Path 3:
1. The factory produces 800 widgets daily.
2. 5% are defective, so defective widgets = 800 * 0.05 = 40.
3. Non-defective widgets = 800 - 40 = 760.
4. Cost to produce all widgets = 800 * $3 = $2400.
5. Revenue from selling non-defective widgets = 760 * $8 = $6080.
6. Profit = Revenue - Cost = $6080 - $2400 = $3680.
Answer: $3680.

Path 4:
1. Daily production = 800 widgets.
2. Defective rate = 5%, leading to 40 defective widgets.
3. Non-defective = 800 - 40 = 760.
4. Total cost = 800 * $3 = $2400.
5. Total revenue from non-defective = 760 * $8 = $6080.
6. Profit = $6080 - $2400 = $3680.
Answer: $3680.

Step 2: Analyze Uncertainty and Majority Answer
All paths agree on the answer: $3680. The confidence is high as all reasoning paths lead to the same conclusion.

Step 3: Apply Threshold and Select Answer
Since all paths agree, the majority answer is selected.

Step 4: Final Solution
The expected daily profit after accounting for defects is $3680. This was determined by calculating the total revenue from non-defective widgets and subtracting the total production cost.
