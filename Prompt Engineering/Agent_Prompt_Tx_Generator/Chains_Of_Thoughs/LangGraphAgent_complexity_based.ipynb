    "    \n",
    "    Step 1: Problem complexity assessment:\n",
    "    This is a multi-step algebraic word problem that requires:\n",
    "    - Understanding the pricing structure (different rates for first vs. additional kg)\n",
    "    - Setting up and solving an equation with variables\n",
    "    - Checking if the solution makes sense in the context\n",

    "    - Total shipping cost is $80\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Let's set up an equation:\n",
    "    - For x kg, we have 1 kg at $10 and (x-1) kg at $7 each\n",
    "    - This gives us: 10 + 7(x-1) = 80\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Let's solve this equation:\n",
    "    - 10 + 7x - 7 = 80\n",
    "    - 7x + 3 = 80\n",
    "    - 7x = 77\n",

    "    - Total: $10 + $70 = $80\n",

    "    - If the package weighed x kg, then the cost would be: 10 + 7(x-1)\n",
    "    - We can rewrite this as: 10 + 7x - 7 = 3 + 7x\n",
    "    - Setting this equal to $80: 3 + 7x = 80\n",
