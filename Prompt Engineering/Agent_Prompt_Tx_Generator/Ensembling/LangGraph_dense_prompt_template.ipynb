    "# Demonstration Ensembling (DENSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstration Ensembling, also known by the acronym DENSE and introduced by Khalifa et al. (2023), is an innovative method that enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging the diversity of learning examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does Demonstration Ensembling Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're preparing a student for a complex exam. Instead of offering them a single set of practice exercises, you could be more effective by presenting several different sets of examples, then combining the best problem-solving strategies from each set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstration Ensembling follows this logic in three key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creation of multiple prompts**: Several few-shot prompts are generated, each containing a distinct subset of examples relevant to the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generation of independent responses**: The model produces a response for each prompt, with each response being influenced by the specific examples in its corresponding prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Intelligent aggregation**: The different responses are analyzed and combined to produce a final response that integrates the strengths of each individual response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For which types of questions is DENSE particularly suitable?\n",
    "\n",
    "The DENSE technique is particularly effective for the following types of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex Multidimensional Analyses\n",
    "- Market analysis problems requiring different sectoral perspectives\n",
    "- Public policy questions involving multiple domains of expertise\n",
    "- Interdisciplinary scientific analyses requiring various methodological approaches\n",
    "- Strategic assessments needing integration of multiple factors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creative Problem Solving\n",
    "- Design of innovative solutions benefiting from multiple approaches\n",
    "- Development of communication strategies for different audiences\n",
    "- Elaboration of action plans requiring varied perspectives\n",
    "- Resolution of technological challenges involving diverse considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Making\n",
    "- Risk assessments requiring different analytical perspectives\n",
    "- Strategic choices benefiting from multiple decision frameworks\n",
    "- Ethical questions involving various frames of reference\n",
    "- Trend predictions integrating different extrapolation approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concrete Examples of Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"What would be the most effective strategies to reduce carbon emissions in urban areas?\"\n",
    "   - DENSE would use one set of examples on transportation, another on building energy efficiency, and a third on consumer behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"How could employee engagement be improved in a company undergoing digital transformation?\"\n",
    "   - DENSE would leverage examples on training, others on reward systems, and still others on internal communication\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"What factors should be considered when developing a new food product for international markets?\"\n",
    "   - DENSE would combine examples on cultural preferences, regulations, and logistical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"How could we design an educational system that better prepares students for the skills required in the 21st century?\"\n",
    "   - DENSE would integrate examples on innovative pedagogies, socio-emotional skills development, and technological integration\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"What approaches might be most effective for improving the resilience of global supply chains?\"\n",
    "   - DENSE would use examples on supplier diversification, traceability technologies, and storage strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstration Ensembling is particularly effective for these types of questions because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It reduces the variance and biases inherent in a single set of examples\n",
    "- It improves the robustness of responses by integrating diverse perspectives\n",
    "- It effectively manages uncertainty by aggregating multiple approaches\n",
    "- It produces more complete and nuanced responses\n",
    "- It mimics the collective decision-making process of expert groups who compare their analyses before formulating a conclusion"

      "To effectively reduce carbon emissions in urban areas while maintaining economic growth, a multi-faceted approach is essential. Key strategies include:\n",

      "1. **Enhancing Public Transportation**: Invest in reliable and efficient public transit systems, subsidize fares, and create incentives for using public transport over personal vehicles to reduce reliance on cars.\n",

      "3. **Smart Urban Planning**: Design mixed-use developments that minimize travel distances, increase green spaces, and promote walkability, which can significantly lower emissions while enhancing urban livability.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Engaging Businesses**: Encourage companies to adopt energy-efficient practices and invest in green technologies, which can lead to cost savings and attract environmentally conscious consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Community Involvement**: Foster community programs that educate residents on sustainability, promote local initiatives, and encourage participation in urban greening projects to build a culture of environmental responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Utilizing Financial Incentives**: Offer tax breaks for businesses that reduce their carbon footprint and provide subsidies for energy-efficient appliances and public transit improvements to stimulate economic growth alongside emission reductions.\n",
