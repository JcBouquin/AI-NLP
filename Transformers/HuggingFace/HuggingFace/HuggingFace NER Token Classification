The `seqeval` framework will give us a nice set of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, and all we need to do is pass it some predictions and labels. But if these aren't Keras Metric objects, how can we use them in the middle of our training loop? The answer is the `KerasMetricCallback`.

It's straightforward - we simply define a function that takes the `predictions` and `labels` from the validation set and computes a dict of one or more metrics, then pass that function and the validation data to the callback. Note that we discard all predictions where the label is `-100` - this indicates a missing label, either because there's no label for that token, or the token is a padding token.
