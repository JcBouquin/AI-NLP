There are two ways to do this - we can use the slightly more low-level [`Dataset.to_tf_dataset()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.to_tf_dataset) method, or we can use [`Model.prepare_tf_dataset()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.prepare_tf_dataset). The main difference between these two is that the `Model` method can inspect the model to determine which column names it can use as input, which means you don't need to specify them yourself. It also supplies a default data collator that will work fine for us, as our samples are already padded to the same length and ready to go."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":55,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":836,"status":"ok","timestamp":1695136469546,"user":{"displayName":"Jean-Christophe Bouquin","userId":"01239462757709491259"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"PgBCrf31NAYF"},"outputs":[],"source":["train_set = model.prepare_tf_dataset(\n","    tokenized_datasets[\"train\"],\n","    shuffle=True,\n","    batch_size=batch_size,\n",")\n","\n","validation_set = model.prepare_tf_dataset(\n","    tokenized_datasets[\"validation\"],\n","    shuffle=False,\n","    batch_size=batch_size,\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RpyZxRnVNAYF"},"source":["Next, we can create an optimizer and specify a loss function.
