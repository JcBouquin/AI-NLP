The functions used in our graph-based text indexing paradigm are described as: • Extracting Entities and Relationships. R(·): This function prompts a LLM to identify entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) within the text data. For instance, it can extract entities like \"Cardiologists\" and \"Heart Disease,\" and relationships such as \"Cardiologists diagnose Heart Disease\" from the text: \"Cardiologists assess symptoms to identify potential heart issues.\" To improve efficiency, the raw text D is segmented into multiple chunks Di. • LLMProfiling for Key-Value Pair Generation. P(·): We employ a LLM-empowered profiling function, P(·), to generate a text key-value pair (K,V ) for each entity node in V and relation edge in E. Each index key is a word or short phrase that enables efficient retrieval, while the corresponding value is a text paragraph summarizing relevant snippets from external data to aid in text generation. Entities use their names as the sole index key, whereas relations may have multiple index keys derived from LLM enhancements that include global themes from connected entities. • Deduplication to Optimize Graph Operations. D(·): Finally, we implement a deduplication function, D(·), that identifies and merges identical entities and relations from different segments of 3 the raw text Di. This process effectively reduces the overhead associated with graph operations on ˆ Dbyminimizing the graph’s size, leading to more efficient data processing. Our LightRAG offers two advantages through its graph-based text indexing paradigm. First, Com prehensive Information Understanding. The constructed graph structures enable the extraction of global information from multi-hop subgraphs, greatly enhancing LightRAG’s ability to handle complex queries that span multiple document chunks. Second, Enhanced Retrieval Performance. the key-value data structures derived from the graph are optimized for rapid and precise retrieval. This provides a superior alternative to less accurate embedding matching methods (Gao et al., 2023) and inefficient chunk traversal techniques (Edge et al., 2024) commonly used in existing approaches. Fast Adaptation to Incremental Knowledge Base. To efficiently adapt to evolving data changes while ensuring accurate and relevant responses, our LightRAG incrementally updates the knowledge base without the need for complete reprocessing of the entire external database. For a new document D′, the incremental update algorithm processes it using the same graph-based indexing steps φ as before, resulting in ˆ D′ =(ˆV′, ˆE′). Subsequently, LightRAGcombines the new graph data with the original by taking the union of the node sets ˆV and ˆV′, as well as the edge sets ˆ E and ˆE′. Two key objectives guide our approach to fast adaptation for the incremental knowledge base: Seam less Integration of New Data. By applying a consistent methodology to new information, the incremental update module allows the LightRAG to integrate new external databases without disrupt ing the existing graph structure. This approach preserves the integrity of established connections, ensuring that historical data remains accessible while enriching the graph without conflicts or redun dancies. Reducing Computational Overhead . By eliminating the need to rebuild the entire index graph, this method reduces computational overhead and facilitates the rapid assimilation of new data. Consequently, LightRAG maintains system accuracy, provides current information, and conserves resources, ensuring users receive timely updates and enhancing the overall RAG effectiveness. 3.2 DUAL-LEVEL RETRIEVAL PARADIGM To retrieve relevant information from both specific document chunks and their complex inter dependencies, our LightRAG proposes generating query keys at both detailed and abstract levels. • Specific Queries. These queries are detail-oriented and typically reference specific entities within the graph, requiring precise retrieval of information associated with particular nodes or edges. For example, a specific query might be, “Who wrote ’Pride and Prejudice’?” • Abstract Queries. In contrast, abstract queries are more conceptual, encompassing broader topics, summaries, or overarching themes that are not directly tied to specific entities. An example of an abstract query is, “How does artificial intelligence influence modern education?” To accommodate diverse query types, the LightRAG employs two distinct retrieval strategies within the dual-level retrieval paradigm. This ensures that both specific and abstract inquiries are addressed effectively, allowing the system to deliver relevant responses tailored to user needs. • Low-Level Retrieval. This level is primarily focused on retrieving specific entities along with their associated attributes or relationships. Queries at this level are detail-oriented and aim to extract precise information about particular nodes or edges within the graph. • High-Level Retrieval. This level addresses broader topics and overarching themes. Queries at this level aggregate information across multiple related entities and relationships, providing insights into higher-level concepts and summaries rather than specific details. Integrating Graph and Vectors for Efficient Retrieval. By combining graph structures with vector representations, the model gains a deeper insight into the interrelationships among entities. This synergy enables the retrieval algorithm to effectively utilize both local and global keywords, streamlining the search process and improving the relevance of results. • (i) Query Keyword Extraction. For a given query q, the retrieval algorithm of LightRAG begins by extracting both local query keywords k(l) and global query keywords k(g). • (ii) Keyword Matching. The algorithm uses an efficient vector database to match local query keywords with candidate entities and global query keywords with relations linked to global keys. 4 • (iii) Incorporating High-Order Relatedness. To enhance the query with higher-order relatedness, LightRAGfurther gathers neighboring nodes within the local subgraphs of the retrieved graph elements. This process involves the set {vi|vi ∈ V ∧ (vi ∈ Nv ∨ vi ∈ Ne)}, where Nv and Ne represent the\n```\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity.

Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of LightRAG in comparison to existing RAG models. These assessments focused on several key dimensions, including retrieval accuracy, model ablation, response efficiency, and adaptability to new information. The results demonstrated significant improvements over baseline methods. 2 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates user queries with a collection of pertinent doc uments sourced from an external knowledge database, incorporating two essential elements: the Retrieval Component and the Generation Component. 1) The retrieval component is responsible for fetching relevant documents or information from the external knowledge database. It identifies and retrieves the most pertinent data based on the input query. 2) After the retrieval process, the generation component takes the retrieved information and generates coherent, contextually relevant responses. It leverages the capabilities of the language model to produce meaningful outputs. Formally, this RAG framework, denoted as M, can be defined as follows: M= G, R=(φ,ψ) , M(q;D)=G q,ψ(q; ˆD) , ˆD =φ(D) (1) In this framework, G and R represent the generation module and the retrieval module, respectively, while q denotes the input query and D refers to the external database.

By leveraging the information retrieved through ψ(·) along with the initial query q, the generative model G(·) efficiently produces high-quality, contextually relevant responses. In this work, we target several key points essential for an efficient and effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system which are elaborated below: • Comprehensive Information Retrieval: The indexing function φ(·) must be adept at extracting global information, as this is crucial for enhancing the model’s ability to answer queries effectively. • Efficient and Low-Cost Retrieval: The indexed data structure ˆ D must enable rapid and cost efficient retrieval to effectively handle a high volume of queries. • Fast Adaptation to Data Changes: The ability to swiftly and efficiently adjust the data structure to incorporate new information from the external knowledge base, is crucial for ensuring that the system remains current and relevant in an ever-changing information landscape. 3 THELIGHTRAG ARCHITECTURE 3.1 GRAPH-BASED TEXT INDEXING Graph-Enhanced Entity and Relationship Extraction. Our LightRAG enhances the retrieval system by segmenting documents into smaller, more manageable pieces. This strategy allows for quick identification and access to relevant information without analyzing entire documents. Next, we leverage LLMs to identify and extract various entities (e.g., names, dates, locations, and events) along with the relationships between them. The information collected through this process will be used to create a comprehensive knowledge graph that highlights the connections and insights across the entire collection of documents. We formally represent this graph generation module as follows: ˆ D=(ˆV, ˆE) = Dedupe◦Prof(V,E), V,E = ∪Di∈DRecog(Di) (2) where ˆD represents the resulting knowledge graphs. To generate this data, we apply three main processing steps to the raw text documents Di. These steps utilize a LLM for text analysis and processing. Details about the prompt templates and specific settings for this part can be found in Appendix 7.3.2. The functions used in our graph-based text indexing paradigm are described as: • Extracting Entities and Relationships. R(·): This function prompts a LLM to identify entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) within the text data.

By eliminating the need to rebuild the entire index, LightRAG reduces computational costs and accelerates adaptation, while its incremental update algorithm ensures timely integration of new data, maintaining effectiveness in dynamic environments. • Experimental Findings. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of LightRAG in comparison to existing RAG models. These assessments focused on several key dimensions, including retrieval accuracy, model ablation, response efficiency, and adaptability to new information. The results demonstrated significant improvements over baseline methods. 2 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates user queries with a collection of pertinent doc uments sourced from an external knowledge database, incorporating two essential elements: the Retrieval Component and the Generation Component. 1) The retrieval component is responsible for fetching relevant documents or information from the external knowledge database. It identifies and retrieves the most pertinent data based on the input query. 2) After the retrieval process, the generation component takes the retrieved information and generates coherent, contextually relevant responses. It leverages the capabilities of the language model to produce meaningful outputs. Formally, this RAG framework, denoted as M, can be defined as follows: M= G, R=(φ,ψ) , M(q;D)=G q,ψ(q; ˆD) , ˆD =φ(D) (1) In this framework, G and R represent the generation module and the retrieval module, respectively, while q denotes the input query and D refers to the external database. The retrieval module R 2 ... BEEKEEPER‘s practices involve the methods and strategies employed by beekeepers to manage bee colonies and ensure their health and productivity.

By leveraging the information retrieved through ψ(·) along with the initial query q, the generative model G(·) efficiently produces high-quality, contextually relevant responses. In this work, we target several key points essential for an efficient and effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system which are elaborated below: • Comprehensive Information Retrieval: The indexing function φ(·) must be adept at extracting global information, as this is crucial for enhancing the model’s ability to answer queries effectively. • Efficient and Low-Cost Retrieval: The indexed data structure ˆ D must enable rapid and cost efficient retrieval to effectively handle a high volume of queries. • Fast Adaptation to Data Changes: The ability to swiftly and efficiently adjust the data structure to incorporate new information from the external knowledge base, is crucial for ensuring that the system remains current and relevant in an ever-changing information landscape. 3 THELIGHTRAG ARCHITECTURE 3.1 GRAPH-BASED TEXT INDEXING Graph-Enhanced Entity and Relationship Extraction. Our LightRAG enhances the retrieval system by segmenting documents into smaller, more manageable pieces. This strategy allows for quick identification and access to relevant information without analyzing entire documents. Next, we leverage LLMs to identify and extract various entities (e.g., names, dates, locations, and events) along with the relationships between them. The information collected through this process will be used to create a comprehensive knowledge graph that highlights the connections and insights across the entire collection of documents. We formally represent this graph generation module as follows: ˆ D=(ˆV, ˆE) = Dedupe◦Prof(V,E), V,E = ∪Di∈DRecog(Di) (2) where ˆD represents the resulting knowledge graphs. To generate this data, we apply three main processing steps to the raw text documents Di. These steps utilize a LLM for text analysis and processing. Details about the prompt templates and specific settings for this part can be found in Appendix 7.3.2.

However, existing RAG systems have significant limitations, including reliance on flat data representa tions and inadequate contextual awareness, which can lead to fragmented answers that fail to capture complex inter-dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose LightRAG, which incorporates graph structures into text indexing and retrieval processes. This innovative framework employs a dual-level retrieval sys tem that enhances comprehensive information retrieval from both low-level and high-level knowledge discovery. Additionally, the integration of graph structures with vector representations facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and their relationships, significantly improving response times while maintaining contextual relevance. This capability is further enhanced by an incremental update algorithm that ensures the timely integration of new data, allowing the system to remain effective and responsive in rapidly changing data environments. Extensive experi mental validation demonstrates considerable improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches. We have made our LightRAG open-source and available at the link: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG. 1 INTRODUCTION Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been developed to enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources Sudhi et al. (2024); Es et al. (2024); Salemi & Zamani (2024). This innovative integration allows LLMs to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses, significantly improving their utility in real-world applications. By adapting to specific domain knowledge Tu et al. (2024), RAG systems ensure that the information provided is not only pertinent but also tailored to the user’s needs. Furthermore, they offer access to up-to-date information Zhao et al. (2024), which is crucial in rapidly evolving fields. Chunking plays a vital role in facilitating the retrieval-augmented generation process Lyu et al. (2024). By breaking down a large external text corpus into smaller, more manageable segments, chunking significantly enhances the accuracy of information retrieval. This approach allows for more targeted similarity searches, ensuring that the retrieved content is directly relevant to user queries. However, existing RAG systems have key limitations that hinder their performance. First, many methods rely on flat data representations, restricting their ability to understand and retrieve information based on intricate relationships between entities. Second, these systems often lack the contextual awareness needed to maintain coherence across various entities and their interrelations, resulting in responses that may not fully address user queries. For example, consider a user asking, “How does the rise of electric vehicles influence urban air quality and public transportation infrastructure?” Existing RAG methods might retrieve separate documents on electric vehicles, air pollution, and public transportation challenges but struggle to synthesize this information into a cohesive response. They may fail to explain how the adoption of electric vehicles can improve air quality, which in turn ∗Both Chao Huang and Yanhua Yu are corresponding authors. 1 could affect public transportation planning. As a result, the user may receive a fragmented answer that does not adequately capture the complex inter-dependencies among these topics. To address these limitations, we propose incorporating graph structures into text indexing and relevant information retrieval. Graphs are particularly effective at representing the interdependencies among different entities Rampášek et al. (2022), which enables a more nuanced understanding of relationships. The integration of graph-based knowledge structures facilitates the synthesis of information from multiple sources into coherent and contextually rich responses. Despite these advantages, developing a fast and scalable graph-empowered RAG system that efficiently handles varying query volumes is crucial. In this work, we achieve an effective and efficient RAG system by addressing three key challenges: i) Comprehensive Information Retrieval. Ensuring comprehensive information retrieval that captures the full context of inter-dependent entities from all documents; ii) Enhanced Retrieval Efficiency. Improving retrieval efficiency over the graph-based knowledge structures to significantly reduce response times; iii) Rapid Adaptation to New Data. Enabling quick adaptation to new data updates, ensuring the system remains relevant in dynamic environments. In response to the outlined challenges, we propose LightRAG, a model that seamlessly integrates a graph-based text indexing paradigm with a dual-level retrieval framework. This innovative approach enhances the system’s capacity to capture complex inter-dependencies among entities, resulting in more coherent and contextually rich responses. LightRAG employs efficient dual-level retrieval strategies: low-level retrieval, which focuses on precise information about specific entities and their relationships, and high-level retrieval, which encompasses broader topics and themes. By combining both detailed and conceptual retrieval, LightRAG effectively accommodates a diverse range of quries, ensuring that users receive relevant and comprehensive responses tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, by integrating graph structures with vector representations, our framework facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and relations while enhancing the comprehensiveness of results through relevant structural information from the constructed knowledge graph. In summary, the key contributions of this work are highlighted as follows: • General Aspect. We emphasize the importance of developing a graph-empowered RAG system to overcome the limitations of existing methods. By integrating graph structures into text indexing, we can effectively represent complex interdependencies among entities, fostering a nuanced understanding of relationships and enabling coherent, contextually rich responses. • Methodologies. To enable an efficient and adaptive RAG system, we propose LightRAG, which integrates a dual-level retrieval paradigm with graph-enhanced text indexing. This approach captures both low-level and high-level information for comprehensive, cost-effective retrieval. By eliminating the need to rebuild the entire index, LightRAG reduces computational costs and accelerates adaptation, while its incremental update algorithm ensures timely integration of new data, maintaining effectiveness in dynamic environments. • Experimental Findings. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of LightRAG in comparison to existing RAG models. These assessments focused on several key dimensions, including retrieval accuracy, model ablation, response efficiency, and adaptability\n```\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity.

The functions used in our graph-based text indexing paradigm are described as: • Extracting Entities and Relationships. R(·): This function prompts a LLM to identify entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) within the text data. For instance, it can extract entities like \\\"Cardiologists\\\" and \\\"Heart Disease,\\\" and relationships such as \\\"Cardiologists diagnose Heart Disease\\\" from the text: \\\"Cardiologists assess symptoms to identify potential heart issues.\\\" To improve efficiency, the raw text D is segmented into multiple chunks Di. • LLMProfiling for Key-Value Pair Generation. P(·): We employ a LLM-empowered profiling function, P(·), to generate a text key-value pair (K,V ) for each entity node in V and relation edge in E. Each index key is a word or short phrase that enables efficient retrieval, while the corresponding value is a text paragraph summarizing relevant snippets from external data to aid in text generation. Entities use their names as the sole index key, whereas relations may have multiple index keys derived from LLM enhancements that include global themes from connected entities. • Deduplication to Optimize Graph Operations. D(·): Finally, we implement a deduplication function, D(·), that identifies and merges identical entities and relations from different segments of 3 the raw text Di. This process effectively reduces the overhead associated with graph operations on ˆ Dbyminimizing the graph’s size, leading to more efficient data processing. Our LightRAG offers two advantages through its graph-based text indexing paradigm. First, Com prehensive Information Understanding. The constructed graph structures enable the extraction of global information from multi-hop subgraphs, greatly enhancing LightRAG’s ability to handle complex queries that span multiple document chunks. Second, Enhanced Retrieval Performance. the key-value data structures derived from the graph are optimized for rapid and precise retrieval. This provides a superior alternative to less accurate embedding matching methods (Gao et al., 2023) and inefficient chunk traversal techniques (Edge et al., 2024) commonly used in existing approaches. Fast Adaptation to Incremental Knowledge Base. To efficiently adapt to evolving data changes while ensuring accurate and relevant responses, our LightRAG incrementally updates the knowledge base without the need for complete reprocessing of the entire external database. For a new document D′, the incremental update algorithm processes it using the same graph-based indexing steps φ as before, resulting in ˆ D′ =(ˆV′, ˆE′). Subsequently, LightRAGcombines the new graph data with the original by taking the union of the node sets ˆV and ˆV′, as well as the edge sets ˆ E and ˆE′. Two key objectives guide our approach to fast adaptation for the incremental knowledge base: Seam less Integration of New Data. By applying a consistent methodology to new information, the incremental update module allows the LightRAG to integrate new external databases without disrupt ing the existing graph structure. This approach preserves the integrity of established connections, ensuring that historical data remains accessible while enriching the graph without conflicts or redun dancies. Reducing Computational Overhead . By eliminating the need to rebuild the entire index graph, this method reduces computational overhead and facilitates the rapid assimilation of new data. Consequently, LightRAG maintains system accuracy, provides current information, and conserves resources, ensuring users receive timely updates and enhancing the overall RAG effectiveness. 3.2 DUAL-LEVEL RETRIEVAL PARADIGM To retrieve relevant information from both specific document chunks and their complex inter dependencies, our LightRAG proposes generating query keys at both detailed and abstract levels. • Specific Queries. These queries are detail-oriented and typically reference specific entities within the graph, requiring precise retrieval of information associated with particular nodes or edges. For example, a specific query might be, “Who wrote ’Pride and Prejudice’?” • Abstract Queries. In contrast, abstract queries are more conceptual, encompassing broader topics, summaries, or overarching themes that are not directly tied to specific entities. An example of an abstract query is, “How does artificial intelligence influence modern education?” To accommodate diverse query types, the LightRAG employs two distinct retrieval strategies within the dual-level retrieval paradigm. This ensures that both specific and abstract inquiries are addressed effectively, allowing the system to deliver relevant responses tailored to user needs. • Low-Level Retrieval. This level is primarily focused on retrieving specific entities along with their associated attributes or relationships. Queries at this level are detail-oriented and aim to extract precise information about particular nodes or edges within the graph. • High-Level Retrieval. This level addresses broader topics and overarching themes. Queries at this level aggregate information across multiple related entities and relationships, providing insights into higher-level concepts and summaries rather than specific details. Integrating Graph and Vectors for Efficient Retrieval. By combining graph structures with vector representations, the model gains a deeper insight into the interrelationships among entities. This synergy enables the retrieval algorithm to effectively utilize both local and global keywords, streamlining the search process and improving the relevance of results. • (i) Query Keyword Extraction. For a given query q, the retrieval algorithm of LightRAG begins by extracting both local query keywords k(l) and global query keywords k(g). • (ii) Keyword Matching. The algorithm uses an efficient vector database to match local query keywords with candidate entities and global query keywords with relations linked to global keys. 4 • (iii) Incorporating High-Order Relatedness. To enhance the query with higher-order relatedness, LightRAGfurther gathers neighboring nodes within the local subgraphs of the retrieved graph elements. This process involves the set {vi|vi ∈ V ∧ (vi ∈ Nv ∨ vi ∈ Ne)}, where Nv and Ne represent the\\n```\\n\\n<Output>\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"entity<|#|>Appendix 7.3.2<|#|>concept<|#|>Appendix 7.3.2 contains details about the prompt templates and specific settings for text indexing in the given context.\\nentity<|#|>Cardiologists<|#|>person<|#|>Cardiologists are medical professionals who assess symptoms to diagnose heart-related issues.\\nentity<|#|>Heart Disease<|#|>concept<|#|>Heart disease represents various cardiovascular conditions that can be diagnosed by medical professionals like cardiologists.\\nentity<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>concept<|#|>LightRAG is a graph-based text indexing paradigm designed for efficient entity and relationship extraction, and adaptation to changing data.\\nentity<|#|>3D Graph<|#|>concept<|#|>A 3D graph structure enhances understanding and retrieval of information within a complex dataset.\\nentity<|#|>Graph Structures<|#|>concept<|#|>Graph structures are used to represent entities and their relationships in a manner that facilitates efficient retrieval and understanding.\\nentity<|#|>Incremental Knowledge Base<|#|>concept<|#|>The incremental knowledge base is a system feature that allows for updates without fully reprocessing data, ensuring accuracy and resource efficiency.\\nrelation<|#|>Cardiologists<|#|>Heart Disease<|#|>diagnosis, medical relationship<|#|>Cardiologists diagnose heart disease based on assessed symptoms.\\nrelation<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>Graph Structures<|#|>data indexing, efficiency<|#|>LightRAG utilizes graph structures to optimize data indexing and retrieval processes.\\nrelation<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>Incremental Knowledge Base<|#|>data adaptation, efficiency<|#|>LightRAG adapts to changes in data within the incremental knowledge base without complete reprocessing.\\nrelation<|#|>Graph Structures<|#|>Incremental Knowledge Base<|#|>data structure, information integrity<|#|>Graph structures preserve information integrity within the incremental knowledge base.\\n<|COMPLETE|>\"}]",

To enhance the query with higher-order relatedness, LightRAGfurther gathers neighboring nodes within the local subgraphs of the retrieved graph elements. This process involves the set {vi|vi ∈ V ∧ (vi ∈ Nv ∨ vi ∈ Ne)}, where Nv and Ne represent the one-hop neighboring nodes of the retrieved nodes v and edges e, respectively. This dual-level retrieval paradigm not only facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and relations through keyword matching, but also enhances the comprehensiveness of results by integrating relevant structural information from the constructed knowledge graph. 3.3 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED ANSWER GENERATION Utilization of Retrieved Information. Utilizing the retrieved information ψ(q; ˆ D), our LightRAG employs a general-purpose LLM to generate answers based on the collected data. This data comprises concatenated values V from relevant entities and relations, produced by the profiling function P(·). It includes names, descriptions of entities and relations, and excerpts from the original text. Context Integration and Answer Generation. By unifying the query with this multi-source text, the LLM generates informative answers tailored to the user’s needs, ensuring alignment with the query’s intent. This approach streamlines the answer generation process by integrating both context and query into the LLM model, as illustrated in detailed examples (Appendix 7.2). 3.4 COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS OF THE LIGHTRAG FRAMEWORK In this section, we analyze the complexity of our proposed LightRAG framework, which can be divided into two main parts. The first part is the graph-based Index phase. During this phase, we use the large language model (LLM) to extract entities and relationships from each chunk of text. As a result, the LLM needs to be called totaltokens chunk size times. Importantly, there is no additional overhead involved in this process, making our approach highly efficient in managing updates to new text. The second part of the process involves the graph-based retrieval phase. For each query, we first utilize the large language model (LLM) to generate relevant keywords. Similar to current Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems Gao et al. (2023; 2022); Chan et al. (2024), our retrieval mechanism relies on vector-based search. However, instead of retrieving chunks as in conventional RAG, we concentrate on retrieving entities and relationships. This approach markedly reduces retrieval overhead compared to the community-based traversal method used in GraphRAG. 4 EVALUATION We conduct empirical evaluations on benchmark data to assess the effectiveness of the proposed LightRAG framework by addressing the following research questions: • (RQ1): How does LightRAG compare to existing RAG baseline methods in terms of generation performance? • (RQ2): How do dual-level retrieval and graph-based indexing enhance the generation quality of LightRAG? • (RQ3): What specific advantages does LightRAG demonstrate through case examples in various scenarios? • (RQ4): What are the costs associated with LightRAG, as well as its adaptability to data changes? 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS Evaluation Datasets. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of LightRAG, we selected four datasets from the UltraDomain benchmark (Qian et al., 2024). The UltraDomain data is sourced from 428 college textbooks and encompasses 18 distinct domains, including agriculture, social sciences, and humanities. From these, we chose the Agriculture, CS, Legal, and Mix datasets. Each dataset contains between 600,000 and 5,000,000 tokens, with detailed information provided in Table 4. Below is a specific introduction to the four domains utilized in our experiments: • Agriculture: This domain focuses on agricultural practices, covering a range of topics including beekeeping, hive management, crop production, and disease prevention. • CS: This domain focuses on computer science and encompasses key areas of data science and software engineering. It particularly highlights machine learning and big data processing, featuring content on recommendation systems, classification algorithms, and real-time analytics using Spark. 5 • Legal: This domain centers on corporate legal practices, addressing corporate restructuring, legal agreements, regulatory compliance, and governance, with a focus on the legal and financial sectors. • Mixed: This domain presents a rich variety of literary, biographical, and philosophical texts, spanning a broad spectrum of disciplines, including cultural, historical, and philosophical studies. Question Generation. To evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for high-level sensemaking tasks, we consolidate all text content from each dataset as context and adopt the generation method outlined in Edge et al. (2024). Specifically, we instruct an LLM to generate five RAG users, along with five tasks for each user. Each generated user is accompanied by a textual description detailing their expertise and traits that motivate their question-raising activities. Each user task is also described, emphasizing one of the user’s potential intentions when interacting with RAG systems. For each user-task combination, the LLM generates five questions that require an understanding of the entire corpus. In total, this process results in 125 questions for each dataset. Baselines. LightRAG is compared against the following state-of-the-art methods across all datasets: • Naive RAG(Gao et al., 2023): This model serves as a standard baseline in existing RAG systems. It segments raw texts into chunks and stores them in a vector database using text embeddings. For queries, Naive RAG generates vectorized representations to directly retrieve text chunks based on the highest similarity in their representations, ensuring efficient and straightforward matching. • RQ-RAG(Chan et al., 2024): This approach leverages the LLM to\n```\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity.

However, existing RAG systems have significant limitations, including reliance on flat data representa tions and inadequate contextual awareness, which can lead to fragmented answers that fail to capture complex inter-dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose LightRAG, which incorporates graph structures into text indexing and retrieval processes. This innovative framework employs a dual-level retrieval sys tem that enhances comprehensive information retrieval from both low-level and high-level knowledge discovery. Additionally, the integration of graph structures with vector representations facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and their relationships, significantly improving response times while maintaining contextual relevance. This capability is further enhanced by an incremental update algorithm that ensures the timely integration of new data, allowing the system to remain effective and responsive in rapidly changing data environments. Extensive experi mental validation demonstrates considerable improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches. We have made our LightRAG open-source and available at the link: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG. 1 INTRODUCTION Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been developed to enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources Sudhi et al. (2024); Es et al. (2024); Salemi & Zamani (2024). This innovative integration allows LLMs to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses, significantly improving their utility in real-world applications. By adapting to specific domain knowledge Tu et al. (2024), RAG systems ensure that the information provided is not only pertinent but also tailored to the user’s needs. Furthermore, they offer access to up-to-date information Zhao et al. (2024), which is crucial in rapidly evolving fields. Chunking plays a vital role in facilitating the retrieval-augmented generation process Lyu et al. (2024). By breaking down a large external text corpus into smaller, more manageable segments, chunking significantly enhances the accuracy of information retrieval. This approach allows for more targeted similarity searches, ensuring that the retrieved content is directly relevant to user queries. However, existing RAG systems have key limitations that hinder their performance. First, many methods rely on flat data representations, restricting their ability to understand and retrieve information based on intricate relationships between entities. Second, these systems often lack the contextual awareness needed to maintain coherence across various entities and their interrelations, resulting in responses that may not fully address user queries. For example, consider a user asking, “How does the rise of electric vehicles influence urban air quality and public transportation infrastructure?” Existing RAG methods might retrieve separate documents on electric vehicles, air pollution, and public transportation challenges but struggle to synthesize this information into a cohesive response. They may fail to explain how the adoption of electric vehicles can improve air quality, which in turn ∗Both Chao Huang and Yanhua Yu are corresponding authors. 1 could affect public transportation planning. As a result, the user may receive a fragmented answer that does not adequately capture the complex inter-dependencies among these topics. To address these limitations, we propose incorporating graph structures into text indexing and relevant information retrieval. Graphs are particularly effective at representing the interdependencies among different entities Rampášek et al. (2022), which enables a more nuanced understanding of relationships. The integration of graph-based knowledge structures facilitates the synthesis of information from multiple sources into coherent and contextually rich responses. Despite these advantages, developing a fast and scalable graph-empowered RAG system that efficiently handles varying query volumes is crucial. In this work, we achieve an effective and efficient RAG system by addressing three key challenges: i) Comprehensive Information Retrieval. Ensuring comprehensive information retrieval that captures the full context of inter-dependent entities from all documents; ii) Enhanced Retrieval Efficiency. Improving retrieval efficiency over the graph-based knowledge structures to significantly reduce response times; iii) Rapid Adaptation to New Data. Enabling quick adaptation to new data updates, ensuring the system remains relevant in dynamic environments. In response to the outlined challenges, we propose LightRAG, a model that seamlessly integrates a graph-based text indexing paradigm with a dual-level retrieval framework. This innovative approach enhances the system’s capacity to capture complex inter-dependencies among entities, resulting in more coherent and contextually rich responses. LightRAG employs efficient dual-level retrieval strategies: low-level retrieval, which focuses on precise information about specific entities and their relationships, and high-level retrieval, which encompasses broader topics and themes. By combining both detailed and conceptual retrieval, LightRAG effectively accommodates a diverse range of quries, ensuring that users receive relevant and comprehensive responses tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, by integrating graph structures with vector representations, our framework facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and relations while enhancing the comprehensiveness of results through relevant structural information from the constructed knowledge graph. In summary, the key contributions of this work are highlighted as follows: • General Aspect. We emphasize the importance of developing a graph-empowered RAG system to overcome the limitations of existing methods. By integrating graph structures into text indexing, we can effectively represent complex interdependencies among entities, fostering a nuanced understanding of relationships and enabling coherent, contextually rich responses. • Methodologies. To enable an efficient and adaptive RAG system, we propose LightRAG, which integrates a dual-level retrieval paradigm with graph-enhanced text indexing. This approach captures both low-level and high-level information for comprehensive, cost-effective retrieval.

To enhance the query with higher-order relatedness, LightRAGfurther gathers neighboring nodes within the local subgraphs of the retrieved graph elements. This process involves the set {vi|vi ∈ V ∧ (vi ∈ Nv ∨ vi ∈ Ne)}, where Nv and Ne represent the one-hop neighboring nodes of the retrieved nodes v and edges e, respectively. This dual-level retrieval paradigm not only facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and relations through keyword matching, but also enhances the comprehensiveness of results by integrating relevant structural information from the constructed knowledge graph. 3.3 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED ANSWER GENERATION Utilization of Retrieved Information. Utilizing the retrieved information ψ(q; ˆ D), our LightRAG employs a general-purpose LLM to generate answers based on the collected data. This data comprises concatenated values V from relevant entities and relations, produced by the profiling function P(·). It includes names, descriptions of entities and relations, and excerpts from the original text. Context Integration and Answer Generation. By unifying the query with this multi-source text, the LLM generates informative answers tailored to the user’s needs, ensuring alignment with the query’s intent. This approach streamlines the answer generation process by integrating both context and query into the LLM model, as illustrated in detailed examples (Appendix 7.2). 3.4 COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS OF THE LIGHTRAG FRAMEWORK In this section, we analyze the complexity of our proposed LightRAG framework, which can be divided into two main parts. The first part is the graph-based Index phase. During this phase, we use the large language model (LLM) to extract entities and relationships from each chunk of text. As a result, the LLM needs to be called totaltokens chunk size times. Importantly, there is no additional overhead involved in this process, making our approach highly efficient in managing updates to new text. The second part of the process involves the graph-based retrieval phase. For each query, we first utilize the large language model (LLM) to generate relevant keywords. Similar to current Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems Gao et al. (2023; 2022); Chan et al. (2024), our retrieval mechanism relies on vector-based search. However, instead of retrieving chunks as in conventional RAG, we concentrate on retrieving entities and relationships. This approach markedly reduces retrieval overhead compared to the community-based traversal method used in GraphRAG. 4 EVALUATION We conduct empirical evaluations on benchmark data to assess the effectiveness of the proposed LightRAG framework by addressing the following research questions: • (RQ1): How does LightRAG compare to existing RAG baseline methods in terms of generation performance? • (RQ2): How do dual-level retrieval and graph-based indexing enhance the generation quality of LightRAG? • (RQ3): What specific advantages does LightRAG demonstrate through case examples in various scenarios? • (RQ4): What are the costs associated with LightRAG, as well as its adaptability to data changes? 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS Evaluation Datasets. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of LightRAG, we selected four datasets from the UltraDomain benchmark (Qian et al., 2024). The UltraDomain data is sourced from 428 college textbooks and encompasses 18 distinct domains, including agriculture, social sciences, and humanities. From these, we chose the Agriculture, CS, Legal, and Mix datasets. Each dataset contains between 600,000 and 5,000,000 tokens, with detailed information provided in Table 4. Below is a specific introduction to the four domains utilized in our experiments: • Agriculture: This domain focuses on agricultural practices, covering a range of topics including beekeeping, hive management, crop production, and disease prevention. • CS: This domain focuses on computer science and encompasses key areas of data science and software engineering. It particularly highlights machine learning and big data processing, featuring content on recommendation systems, classification algorithms, and real-time analytics using Spark. 5 • Legal: This domain centers on corporate legal practices, addressing corporate restructuring, legal agreements, regulatory compliance, and governance, with a focus on the legal and financial sectors. • Mixed: This domain presents a rich variety of literary, biographical, and philosophical texts, spanning a broad spectrum of disciplines, including cultural, historical, and philosophical studies. Question Generation. To evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for high-level sensemaking tasks, we consolidate all text content from each dataset as context and adopt the generation method outlined in Edge et al. (2024). Specifically, we instruct an LLM to generate five RAG users, along with five tasks for each user. Each generated user is accompanied by a textual description detailing their expertise and traits that motivate their question-raising activities. Each user task is also described, emphasizing one of the user’s potential intentions when interacting with RAG systems. For each user-task combination, the LLM generates five questions that require an understanding of the entire corpus. In total, this process results in 125 questions for each dataset. Baselines. LightRAG is compared against the following state-of-the-art methods across all datasets: • Naive RAG(Gao et al., 2023): This model serves as a standard baseline in existing RAG systems. It segments raw texts into chunks and stores them in a vector database using text embeddings. For queries, Naive RAG generates vectorized representations to directly retrieve text chunks based on the highest similarity in their representations, ensuring efficient and straightforward matching. • RQ-RAG(Chan et al., 2024): This approach leverages the LLM to\\n```\\n\\n<Output>\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"entity<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>concept<|#|>LightRAG is a framework designed for retrieval-augmented generation, utilizing a large language model to enhance information retrieval and answer generation processes.\\nentity<|#|>Large Language Model<|#|>method<|#|>The Large Language Model (LLM) is employed within the LightRAG framework to generate answers and extract entities and relationships from text.\\nentity<|#|>Graph-Based Index Phase<|#|>concept<|#|>The Graph-Based Index Phase is a component of the LightRAG framework where the LLM extracts entities and relationships from text chunks.\\nentity<|#|>Graph-Based Retrieval Phase<|#|>concept<|#|>The Graph-Based Retrieval Phase involves using the LLM to generate relevant keywords and retrieve entities and relationships for processing queries.\\nentity<|#|>UltraDomain Benchmark<|#|>data<|#|>The UltraDomain Benchmark consists of datasets sourced from college textbooks, used to assess the effectiveness of the LightRAG framework across various domains.\\nentity<|#|>Agriculture Domain<|#|>concept<|#|>The Agriculture Domain focuses on agricultural practices and includes topics such as beekeeping, crop production, and disease prevention.\\nentity<|#|>Computer Science Domain<|#|>concept<|#|>The Computer Science Domain encompasses key areas of data science and software engineering, focusing particularly on machine learning and big data processing.\\nentity<|#|>Legal Domain<|#|>concept<|#|>The Legal Domain addresses corporate legal practices including regulatory compliance and corporate restructuring.\\nentity<|#|>Mixed Domain<|#|>concept<|#|>The Mixed Domain presents a variety of texts across disciplines such as cultural, historical, and philosophical studies.\\nentity<|#|>Naive RAG<|#|>method<|#|>Naive RAG is a baseline method in existing retrieval-augmented generation systems, utilizing vector databases for efficient query matching.\\nentity<|#|>RQ-RAG<|#|>method<|#|>RQ-RAG is a method that leverages the LLM for enhanced retrieval-augmented generation tasks.\\nrelation<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>Large Language Model<|#|>framework component, information generation<|#|>LightRAG incorporates the Large Language Model to enhance information retrieval and answer generation.\\nrelation<|#|>Graph-Based Index Phase<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>framework process, entity and relationship extraction<|#|>The Graph-Based Index Phase within LightRAG is where entities and relationships are extracted from text.\\nrelation<|#|>Graph-Based Retrieval Phase<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>framework process, query processing<|#|>The Graph-Based Retrieval Phase is part of LightRAG that focuses on generating keywords and retrieving entities and relationships for queries.\\nrelation<|#|>UltraDomain Benchmark<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>evaluation data, effectiveness assessment<|#|>The UltraDomain Benchmark is used to assess the effectiveness of the LightRAG framework across various datasets.\\nrelation<|#|>Agriculture Domain<|#|>UltraDomain Benchmark<|#|>domain focus, agricultural practices<|#|>The Agriculture Domain is one of the focuses within the UltraDomain Benchmark, covering various agricultural topics.\\nrelation<|#|>Computer Science Domain<|#|>UltraDomain Benchmark<|#|>domain focus, data science and software engineering<|#|>The Computer Science Domain is included in the UltraDomain Benchmark, highlighting topics in data science and software engineering.\\nrelation<|#|>Legal Domain<|#|>UltraDomain Benchmark<|#|>domain focus, corporate legal practices<|#|>The Legal Domain is part of the UltraDomain Benchmark, centered on corporate legal matters.\\nrelation<|#|>Mixed Domain<|#|>UltraDomain Benchmark<|#|>domain focus, diverse texts<|#|>The Mixed Domain features varied literary and philosophical texts within the UltraDomain Benchmark.\\nrelation<|#|>Naive RAG<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>comparative evaluation, baseline method<|#|>Naive RAG serves as a baseline for comparison against the LightRAG framework in retrieval-augmented generation assessments.\\nrelation<|#|>RQ-RAG<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>comparative evaluation, method analysis<|#|>RQ-RAG is compared to LightRAG to analyze the performance of various retrieval-augmented generation approaches.\\n<|COMPLETE|>\"}]",

It segments raw texts into chunks and stores them in a vector database using text embeddings. For queries, Naive RAG generates vectorized representations to directly retrieve text chunks based on the highest similarity in their representations, ensuring efficient and straightforward matching. • RQ-RAG(Chan et al., 2024): This approach leverages the LLM to decompose the input query into multiple sub-queries. These sub-queries are designed to enhance search accuracy by utilizing explicit techniques such as rewriting, decomposition, and disambiguation. • HyDE(Gaoetal., 2022): This method utilizes the LLM to generate a hypothetical document based on the input query. This generated document is then employed to retrieve relevant text chunks, which are subsequently used to formulate the final answer. • GraphRAG(Edge et al., 2024): This is a graph-enhanced RAG system that utilizes an LLM to extract entities and relationships from the text, representing them as nodes and edges. It generates corresponding descriptions for these elements, aggregates nodes into communities, and produces a community report to capture global information. When handling high-level queries, GraphRAG retrieves more comprehensive information by traversing these communities. Implementation and Evaluation Details. In our experiments, we utilize the nano vector database for vector data management and access. For all LLM-based operations in LightRAG, we default to using GPT-4o-mini. To ensure consistency, the chunk size is set to 1200 across all datasets. Additionally, the gleaning parameter is fixed at 1 for both GraphRAG and LightRAG. Defining ground truth for many RAG queries, particularly those involving complex high-level semantics, poses significant challenges. To address this, we build on existing work (Edge et al., 2024) and adopt an LLM-based multi-dimensional comparison method. We employ a robust LLM, specifically GPT-4o-mini, to rank each baseline against our LightRAG. The evaluation prompt we used is detailed in Appendix 7.3.4. In total, we utilize four evaluation dimensions, including: i) Comprehensiveness: How thoroughly does the answer address all aspects and details of the question? ii) Diversity: How varied and rich is the answer in offering different perspectives and insights related to the question? iii) Empowerment: How effectively does the answer enable the reader to understand the topic and make informed judgments? iv) Overall: This dimension assesses the cumulative performance across the three preceding criteria to identify the best overall answer. The LLMdirectly compares two answers for each dimension and selects the superior response for each criterion. After identifying the winning answer for the three dimensions, the LLM combines the results to determine the overall better answer. To ensure a fair evaluation and mitigate the potential bias that could arise from the order in which the answers are presented in the prompt, we alternate the placement of each answer. We calculate win rates accordingly, ultimately leading to the final results. 4.2 COMPARISON OF LIGHTRAG WITH EXISTING RAG METHODS (RQ1) Wecompare LightRAG against each baseline across various evaluation dimensions and datasets. The results are presented in Table 1. Based on these findings, we draw the following conclusions: 6 Table1:Winrates(%)ofbaselinesv.s.LightRAGacrossfourdatasetsandfourevaluationdimensions.

It segments raw texts into chunks and stores them in a vector database using text embeddings. For queries, Naive RAG generates vectorized representations to directly retrieve text chunks based on the highest similarity in their representations, ensuring efficient and straightforward matching. • RQ-RAG(Chan et al., 2024): This approach leverages the LLM to decompose the input query into multiple sub-queries. These sub-queries are designed to enhance search accuracy by utilizing explicit techniques such as rewriting, decomposition, and disambiguation. • HyDE(Gaoetal., 2022): This method utilizes the LLM to generate a hypothetical document based on the input query. This generated document is then employed to retrieve relevant text chunks, which are subsequently used to formulate the final answer. • GraphRAG(Edge et al., 2024): This is a graph-enhanced RAG system that utilizes an LLM to extract entities and relationships from the text, representing them as nodes and edges. It generates corresponding descriptions for these elements, aggregates nodes into communities, and produces a community report to capture global information. When handling high-level queries, GraphRAG retrieves more comprehensive information by traversing these communities. Implementation and Evaluation Details. In our experiments, we utilize the nano vector database for vector data management and access. For all LLM-based operations in LightRAG, we default to using GPT-4o-mini. To ensure consistency, the chunk size is set to 1200 across all datasets. Additionally, the gleaning parameter is fixed at 1 for both GraphRAG and LightRAG. Defining ground truth for many RAG queries, particularly those involving complex high-level semantics, poses significant challenges. To address this, we build on existing work (Edge et al., 2024) and adopt an LLM-based multi-dimensional comparison method. We employ a robust LLM, specifically GPT-4o-mini, to rank each baseline against our LightRAG. The evaluation prompt we used is detailed in Appendix 7.3.4. In total, we utilize four evaluation dimensions, including: i) Comprehensiveness: How thoroughly does the answer address all aspects and details of the question? ii) Diversity: How varied and rich is the answer in offering different perspectives and insights related to the question? iii) Empowerment: How effectively does the answer enable the reader to understand the topic and make informed judgments? iv) Overall: This dimension assesses the cumulative performance across the three preceding criteria to identify the best overall answer. The LLMdirectly compares two answers for each dimension and selects the superior response for each criterion. After identifying the winning answer for the three dimensions, the LLM combines the results to determine the overall better answer. To ensure a fair evaluation and mitigate the potential bias that could arise from the order in which the answers are presented in the prompt, we alternate the placement of each answer.

The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Entity_types>\n[\"Person\",\"Creature\",\"Organization\",\"Location\",\"Event\",\"Concept\",\"Method\",\"Content\",\"Data\",\"Artifact\",\"NaturalObject\"]\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Incontrast,LightRAGoptimizes thisprocessbyusingfewerthan100tokensforkeywordgenerationandretrieval,requiringonlya singleAPIcallfortheentireprocess.Thisefficiencyisachievedthroughourretrievalmechanism, 9 which seamlessly integrates graph structures and vectorized representations for information retrieval, thereby eliminating the need to process large volumes of information upfront. In the incremental data update phase, designed to address changes in dynamic real-world scenarios, both models exhibit similar overhead for entity and relationship extraction. However, GraphRAG shows significant inefficiency in managing newly added data. When a new dataset of the same size as the legal dataset is introduced, GraphRAG must dismantle its existing community structure to incorporate new entities and relationships, followed by complete regeneration. This process incurs a substantial token cost of approximately 5,000 tokens per community report. Given 1,399 communities, GraphRAG would require around 1,399 × 2 × 5,000 tokens to reconstruct both the original and new community reports—an exorbitant expense that underscores its inefficiency. In contrast, LightRAG seamlessly integrates newly extracted entities and relationships into the existing graph without the need for full reconstruction. This approach results in significantly lower overhead during incremental updates, demonstrating its superior efficiency and cost-effectiveness. 5 RELATED WORK 5.1 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION WITH LLMS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLM inputs by retrieving relevant infor mation from external sources, grounding responses in factual, domain-specific knowledge Ram et al. (2023); Fan et al. (2024). Current RAG approaches Gao et al. (2022; 2023); Chan et al. (2024); Yu et al. (2024) typically embed queries in a vector space to find the nearest context vectors. However, many of these methods rely on fragmented text chunks and only retrieve the top-k contexts, limiting their ability to capture comprehensive global information needed for effective responses. Although recent studies Edge et al. (2024) have explored using graph structures for knowledge representation, two key limitations persist. First, these approaches often lack the capability for dynamic updates and expansions of the knowledge graph, making it difficult to incorporate new information effectively. In contrast, our proposed model, LightRAG, addresses these challenges by enabling the RAG system to quickly adapt to new information, ensuring the model’s timeliness and accuracy. Additionally, existing methods often rely on brute-force searches for each generated community, which are inefficient for large-scale queries. Our LightRAG framework overcomes this limitation by facilitating rapid retrieval of relevant information from the graph through our proposed dual-level retrieval paradigm, significantly enhancing both retrieval efficiency and response speed. 5.2 LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL FOR GRAPHS Graphs are a powerful framework for representing complex relationships and find applications in numerous fields. As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, researchers have increasingly focused on enhancing their capability to interpret graph-structured data. This body of work can be divided into three primary categories: i) GNNs as Prefix where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are utilized as the initial processing layer for graph data, generating structure-aware tokens that LLMs can use during inference. Notable examples include GraphGPT Tang et al. (2024) and LLaGA Chen et al. (2024). ii) LLMs as Prefix involves LLMs processing graph data enriched with textual information to produce node embeddings or labels, ultimately\n```\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity.

Incontrast,LightRAGoptimizes thisprocessbyusingfewerthan100tokensforkeywordgenerationandretrieval,requiringonlya singleAPIcallfortheentireprocess.Thisefficiencyisachievedthroughourretrievalmechanism, 9 which seamlessly integrates graph structures and vectorized representations for information retrieval, thereby eliminating the need to process large volumes of information upfront. In the incremental data update phase, designed to address changes in dynamic real-world scenarios, both models exhibit similar overhead for entity and relationship extraction. However, GraphRAG shows significant inefficiency in managing newly added data. When a new dataset of the same size as the legal dataset is introduced, GraphRAG must dismantle its existing community structure to incorporate new entities and relationships, followed by complete regeneration. This process incurs a substantial token cost of approximately 5,000 tokens per community report. Given 1,399 communities, GraphRAG would require around 1,399 × 2 × 5,000 tokens to reconstruct both the original and new community reports—an exorbitant expense that underscores its inefficiency. In contrast, LightRAG seamlessly integrates newly extracted entities and relationships into the existing graph without the need for full reconstruction. This approach results in significantly lower overhead during incremental updates, demonstrating its superior efficiency and cost-effectiveness. 5 RELATED WORK 5.1 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION WITH LLMS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLM inputs by retrieving relevant infor mation from external sources, grounding responses in factual, domain-specific knowledge Ram et al. (2023); Fan et al. (2024). Current RAG approaches Gao et al. (2022; 2023); Chan et al. (2024); Yu et al. (2024) typically embed queries in a vector space to find the nearest context vectors. However, many of these methods rely on fragmented text chunks and only retrieve the top-k contexts, limiting their ability to capture comprehensive global information needed for effective responses. Although recent studies Edge et al. (2024) have explored using graph structures for knowledge representation, two key limitations persist. First, these approaches often lack the capability for dynamic updates and expansions of the knowledge graph, making it difficult to incorporate new information effectively. In contrast, our proposed model, LightRAG, addresses these challenges by enabling the RAG system to quickly adapt to new information, ensuring the model’s timeliness and accuracy. Additionally, existing methods often rely on brute-force searches for each generated community, which are inefficient for large-scale queries. Our LightRAG framework overcomes this limitation by facilitating rapid retrieval of relevant information from the graph through our proposed dual-level retrieval paradigm, significantly enhancing both retrieval efficiency and response speed. 5.2 LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL FOR GRAPHS Graphs are a powerful framework for representing complex relationships and find applications in numerous fields. As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, researchers have increasingly focused on enhancing their capability to interpret graph-structured data. This body of work can be divided into three primary categories: i) GNNs as Prefix where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are utilized as the initial processing layer for graph data, generating structure-aware tokens that LLMs can use during inference. Notable examples include GraphGPT Tang et al. (2024) and LLaGA Chen et al. (2024). ii) LLMs as Prefix involves LLMs processing graph data enriched with textual information to produce node embeddings or labels, ultimately\\n```\\n\\n<Output>\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"entity<|#|>Retrieval-Augmented Generation<|#|>concept<|#|>Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a system that enhances LLM inputs by retrieving relevant information from external sources to ground responses in factual knowledge.\\nentity<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>method<|#|>LightRAG is a proposed model that improves the efficiency of the RAG system by quickly adapting to new information without needing full reconstruction of knowledge graphs.\\nentity<|#|>GraphRAG<|#|>method<|#|>GraphRAG is a baseline model for RAG that exhibits inefficiencies in handling newly added data and requires substantial token costs during community reconstruction.\\nentity<|#|>Large Language Models<|#|>concept<|#|>Large Language Models are advanced AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text, increasingly focused on graph-structured data interpretation.\\nentity<|#|>Token Overhead<|#|>data<|#|>Token overhead represents the number of tokens used in the process of entity and relationship extraction.\\nentity<|#|>Dynamic Environments<|#|>concept<|#|>Dynamic environments refer to changing real-world scenarios that require flexible management of data and models.\\nentity<|#|>Community Structure<|#|>concept<|#|>Community structure in the context of graph models refers to the organization of nodes into groups that reflect relationships or similarities.\\nentity<|#|>Cost Analysis<|#|>concept<|#|>Cost analysis evaluates the token and API call expenditures associated with different retrieval and processing methods in RAG systems.\\nentity<|#|>Graph Neural Networks<|#|>method<|#|>Graph Neural Networks are a type of neural network designed to process graph-structured data and enhance the interpretation of relationships within the data.\\nrelation<|#|>Retrieval-Augmented Generation<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>system enhancement, information retrieval<|#|>Retrieval-Augmented Generation is enhanced by LightRAG, which adapts the system for more efficient information retrieval.\\nrelation<|#|>GraphRAG<|#|>Token Overhead<|#|>inefficiency, resource management<|#|>GraphRAG incurs significant token overhead during the extraction of entities and relationships.\\nrelation<|#|>LightRAG<|#|>Dynamic Environments<|#|>adaptability, efficiency<|#|>LightRAG effectively adapts to changes in dynamic environments without the need for complete reconstruction.\\nrelation<|#|>Community Structure<|#|>Dynamic Environments<|#|>data organization, relationship reflection<|#|>Community structure needs to adapt in dynamic environments to accurately reflect evolving relationships.\\nrelation<|#|>Large Language Models<|#|>Graph Neural Networks<|#|>data processing, relationship interpretation<|#|>Large Language Models are enhanced by Graph Neural Networks that process graph data to interpret relationships better.\\n<|COMPLETE|>\"}]",

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Entity_types>\n[\"Person\",\"Creature\",\"Organization\",\"Location\",\"Event\",\"Concept\",\"Method\",\"Content\",\"Data\",\"Artifact\",\"NaturalObject\"]\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Notable examples include GraphGPT Tang et al. (2024) and LLaGA Chen et al. (2024). ii) LLMs as Prefix involves LLMs processing graph data enriched with textual information to produce node embeddings or labels, ultimately refining the training process for GNNs, as demonstrated in systems like GALM Xie et al. (2023) and OFA Liu et al. (2024). iii) LLMs-Graphs Integration focuses on achieving a seamless interaction between LLMs and graph data, employing techniques such as fusion training and GNN alignment, and developing LLM-based agents capable of engaging with graph information directly Li et al. (2023); Brannon et al. (2023). 6 CONCLUSION This work introduces an advancement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through the integration of a graph-based indexing approach that enhances both efficiency and comprehension in information retrieval. LightRAG utilizes a comprehensive knowledge graph to facilitate rapid and relevant document retrieval, enabling a deeper understanding of complex queries. Its dual-level retrieval paradigm allows for the extraction of both specific and abstract information, catering to diverse user needs. Furthermore, LightRAG’s seamless incremental update capability ensures that the system remains current and responsive to new information, thereby maintaining its effectiveness over time. Overall, LightRAG excels in both efficiency and effectiveness, significantly improving the speed and quality of information retrieval and generation while reducing costs for LLM inference. 10 REFERENCES William Brannon, Suyash Fulay, Hang Jiang, Wonjune Kang, Brandon Roy, Jad Kabbara, and Deb Roy.

Notable examples include GraphGPT Tang et al. (2024) and LLaGA Chen et al. (2024). ii) LLMs as Prefix involves LLMs processing graph data enriched with textual information to produce node embeddings or labels, ultimately refining the training process for GNNs, as demonstrated in systems like GALM Xie et al. (2023) and OFA Liu et al. (2024). iii) LLMs-Graphs Integration focuses on achieving a seamless interaction between LLMs and graph data, employing techniques such as fusion training and GNN alignment, and developing LLM-based agents capable of engaging with graph information directly Li et al. (2023); Brannon et al. (2023). 6 CONCLUSION This work introduces an advancement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through the integration of a graph-based indexing approach that enhances both efficiency and comprehension in information retrieval. LightRAG utilizes a comprehensive knowledge graph to facilitate rapid and relevant document retrieval, enabling a deeper understanding of complex queries. Its dual-level retrieval paradigm allows for the extraction of both specific and abstract information, catering to diverse user needs. Furthermore, LightRAG’s seamless incremental update capability ensures that the system remains current and responsive to new information, thereby maintaining its effectiveness over time. Overall, LightRAG excels in both efficiency and effectiveness, significantly improving the speed and quality of information retrieval and generation while reducing costs for LLM inference. 10 REFERENCES William Brannon, Suyash Fulay, Hang Jiang, Wonjune Kang, Brandon Roy, Jad Kabbara, and Deb Roy.

The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n4.  **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n5.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n6.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant missing or corrected entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n7.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Entity_types>\n[\"Person\",\"Creature\",\"Organization\",\"Location\",\"Event\",\"Concept\",\"Method\",\"Content\",\"Data\",\"Artifact\",\"NaturalObject\"]\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

    "return": "LightRAG is a comprehensive framework designed to enhance information retrieval through the integration of graph structures and advanced algorithms. It utilizes an incremental update algorithm that allows for the efficient assimilation of new data, thereby providing a cost-effective means of retrieving relevant information in dynamic environments.\n\nThe framework is particularly focused on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging a large language model to bolster both information retrieval and answer generation. LightRAG employs a graph-based text indexing paradigm that facilitates the effective extraction of entities and relationships while adapting seamlessly to changing datasets. This innovative method improves not just the retrieval process but also enhances the diversity of generated responses, making it well-suited for applications requiring the understanding of large-scale corpora.\n\nLightRAG's effectiveness extends to various machine learning contexts, as it has been shown to outperform traditional baseline methods in evaluating metrics for systems such as movie recommendations. Additionally, it utilizes the GPT-4o-mini LLM for assessing RAG methodologies across multiple dimensions. The system is designed to maintain high operational efficiency and comprehension in information retrieval, quickly adapting to new information without necessitating a complete reconstruction of knowledge graphs. Overall, LightRAG represents a significant advancement in graph-based approaches to data retrieval and generation.",

    "return": "The complexity analysis of the LightRAG framework consists of two main parts:\n\n### 1. Graph-Based Index Phase\nIn this phase, the LightRAG framework employs a large language model (LLM) to extract entities and relationships from each chunk of text. The complexity involved in this part is characterized by the total number of tokens, which is equal to the chunk size times the number of calls made to the LLM. Notably, this process does not incur additional overhead, making it highly efficient for managing updates to new text.\n\n### 2. Graph-Based Retrieval Phase\nFor each query in this phase, the LLM generates relevant keywords, focusing on efficiently retrieving entities and relationships rather than conventional chunk retrieval methods. This dual-level retrieval paradigm significantly reduces retrieval overhead when compared to the community-based traversal method used in other systems like GraphRAG.\n\n### Summary\nOverall, the LightRAG framework achieves a balance between efficient information retrieval and the effective management of dynamic updates without requiring the complete reconstruction of knowledge graphs. This balance contributes to a significant reduction in complexity and enhances the operational efficiency of the system.\n\n### References\n- [1] Document Title 1\n- [2] Document Title 2\n- [3] Document Title 3\n- [4] Document Title 4\n- [5] Document Title 5",
