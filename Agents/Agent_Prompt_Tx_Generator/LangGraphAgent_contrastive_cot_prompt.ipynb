    "    \n",
    "    Contrastive CoT Prompting is an advanced form of Chain-of-Thought that includes both correct and incorrect reasoning paths to help the model distinguish between valid and invalid approaches.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This technique significantly improves performance on arithmetic reasoning and factual QA tasks by demonstrating both how to reason correctly and how not to reason.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Contrastive CoT process includes the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Problem understanding: Clearly state the problem and identify key information.\n",
    "    2. Incorrect reasoning path: Show a plausible but flawed reasoning process that leads to an incorrect answer.\n",
    "    3. Error identification: Identify the specific mistakes or logical errors in the incorrect approach.\n",
    "    4. Correct reasoning path: Demonstrate the proper reasoning process step by step.\n",
    "    5. Final answer with justification: Provide the correct answer with clear justification.\n",

    "    Example:\n",
    "    Question: \"A store sells notebooks for $2.50 each. If you buy 6 notebooks, how much change will you receive from a $20 bill?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 1: Problem understanding:\n",
    "    I need to calculate how much change I'll receive after buying 6 notebooks at $2.50 each with a $20 bill. This requires figuring out the total cost of the notebooks and then subtracting that from $20.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 2: Incorrect reasoning path:\n",
    "    To find the cost of 6 notebooks, I'll multiply:\n",
    "    6 × $2.50 = $12.50\n",
    "    Then the change would be:\n",
    "    $20 - $12.50 = $7.50\n",
    "    So I would receive $7.50 in change.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 3: Error identification:\n",
    "    Wait, I made a calculation error. When multiplying 6 by $2.50:\n",
    "    6 × $2.50 = 6 × 2.5 = 12 + 3 = $15.00, not $12.50\n",
    "    The error was in the multiplication step, where I incorrectly calculated 6 × $2.50 as $12.50.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    Let's solve this correctly:\n",
    "    Cost of one notebook = $2.50\n",
    "    Cost of 6 notebooks = 6 × $2.50 = $15.00\n",
    "    I give the cashier a $20 bill\n",
    "    Change = $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 5: The correct answer is $5.00 in change. This is justified because 6 notebooks at $2.50 each costs $15.00 in total (6 × $2.50 = $15.00), and when paying with a $20 bill, the change is $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00.\n",
