    "    Contrastive CoT Prompting is an advanced form of Chain-of-Thought that includes both correct and incorrect reasoning paths to help the model distinguish between valid and invalid approaches.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This technique significantly improves performance on arithmetic reasoning and factual QA tasks by demonstrating both how to reason correctly and how not to reason.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Contrastive CoT process includes the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Problem understanding: Clearly state the problem and identify key information.\n",
    "    2. Incorrect reasoning path: Show a plausible but flawed reasoning process that leads to an incorrect answer.\n",
    "    3. Error identification: Identify the specific mistakes or logical errors in the incorrect approach.\n",
    "    4. Correct reasoning path: Demonstrate the proper reasoning process step by step.\n",

    "    Step 1: Problem understanding:\n",
    "    I need to calculate how much change I'll receive after buying 6 notebooks at $2.50 each with a $20 bill. This requires figuring out the total cost of the notebooks and then subtracting that from $20.\n",
