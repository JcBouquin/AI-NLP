=== QUESTION ===

Marie gave half of her apples to Jean. Jean ate three apples, then gave half of what he had left to Pierre. Pierre now has 4 apples. How many apples did Marie have at the beginning?

=== FINAL ANSWER (STEP 5) ===

Final Solution**

To find out how many apples Marie had initially, we can follow these steps:

1. Let M be the number of apples Marie had initially.
2. Marie gave half of her apples to Jean: Jean received M/2 apples.
3. Jean ate 3 apples: Now he has (M/2 - 3) apples left.
4. Jean then gave half of what he had left to Pierre: Pierre received (M/2 - 3)/2 apples.
5. We know Pierre has 4 apples, so we set up the equation:  
   (M/2 - 3)/2 = 4.
6. Solving for M:  
   Multiply both sides by 2: M/2 - 3 = 8.  
   Add 3 to both sides: M/2 = 11.  
   Multiply both sides by 2: M = 22.

Therefore, Marie had 22 apples at the beginning.

**Step 1: Initial Exemplars**

Exemplar 1:  
Q: If Sarah has 10 candies and gives half to her friend, how many does she have left?  
A: To find out how many candies Sarah has left, I need to calculate half of 10.  
Half of 10 = 10 / 2 = 5.  
So, Sarah gives away 5 candies.  
Candies left = 10 - 5 = 5.  
Therefore, Sarah has 5 candies left.

Exemplar 2:  
Q: John had 20 marbles and lost 5. How many does he have now?  
A: First, I need to determine how many marbles John lost.  
He lost 5 marbles.  
Now, I subtract the lost marbles from the original amount.  
Marbles left = 20 - 5 = 15.  
Therefore, John has 15 marbles now.

Exemplar 3:  
Q: Lisa had 15 books and gave 3 to her brother. How many books does she have now?  
A: To find out how many books Lisa has left, I subtract the number of books she gave away from her original amount.  
Books left = 15 - 3 = 12.  
Therefore, Lisa has 12 books now.

**Step 2: First Iteration**

For the question about Marie and her apples:  
1. Let M be the number of apples Marie had initially.  
2. Marie gave half of her apples to Jean, so Jean received M/2 apples.  
3. Jean ate 3 apples, so now he has (M/2 - 3) apples left.  
4. Jean then gave half of what he had left to Pierre, which is (M/2 - 3)/2.  
5. According to the problem, Pierre now has 4 apples.  
6. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
   (M/2 - 3)/2 = 4.  
7. Solving for M:  
   M/2 - 3 = 8 (multiplying both sides by 2)  
   M/2 = 11 (adding 3 to both sides)  
   M = 22 (multiplying both sides by 2)  
   
Thus, Marie had 22 apples initially.

**Step 3: Uncertainty Analysis**

The calculation seems straightforward, but there might be uncertainty in how to handle the operations involving fractions and the sequence of actions (e.g., giving away, eating, and then giving away again). The clarity of the steps taken to arrive at the final answer could be improved.

**Step 4: Refined Exemplars**

Exemplar 1 (Rewritten):  
Q: If Sarah has 10 candies and gives half to her friend, how many does she have left?  
A: To find out how many candies Sarah has left, I first calculate half of 10.  
Half of 10 = 10 / 2 = 5.  
Sarah gives away 5 candies, so I subtract this from her original amount.  
Candies left = 10 - 5 = 5.  
Therefore, Sarah has 5 candies left.

Exemplar 2 (Rewritten):  
Q: John had 20 marbles and lost 5. How many does he have now?  
A: John originally had 20 marbles. After losing 5, I need to subtract the lost marbles from the original amount.  
Marbles left = 20 - 5 = 15.  
Therefore, John has 15 marbles now.

Exemplar 3 (Rewritten):  
Q: Lisa had 15 books and gave 3 to her brother. How many books does she have now?  
A: Lisa starts with 15 books. After giving away 3, I subtract that from her total.  
Books left = 15 - 3 = 12.  
Therefore, Lisa has 12 books now.

**Step 5: Final Solution**

To find out how many apples Marie had initially, we can follow these steps:

1. Let M be the number of apples Marie had initially.
2. Marie gave half of her apples to Jean: Jean received M/2 apples.
3. Jean ate 3 apples: Now he has (M/2 - 3) apples left.
4. Jean then gave half of what he had left to Pierre: Pierre received (M/2 - 3)/2 apples.
5. We know Pierre has 4 apples, so we set up the equation:  
   (M/2 - 3)/2 = 4.
6. Solving for M:  
   Multiply both sides by 2: M/2 - 3 = 8.  
   Add 3 to both sides: M/2 = 11.  
   Multiply both sides by 2: M = 22.

Therefore, Marie had 22 apples at the beginning.
