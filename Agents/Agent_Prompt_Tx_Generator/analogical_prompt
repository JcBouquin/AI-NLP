=== QUESTION ===

How should I architect a distributed system for processing real-time financial transactions that needs to handle 10,000 transactions per second, maintain ACID compliance, and have a recovery time of less than 5 minutes in case of failure?

=== FINAL ANSWER (STEP 4) ===

The architecture for processing real-time financial transactions should include a microservices architecture, a distributed ACID-compliant database, a message queue for decoupling, load balancing for scalability, a robust failover mechanism for quick recovery, and thorough testing to ensure it can handle 10,000 transactions per second with a recovery time of less than 5 minutes.

Step 1: Analogous problem identification:
To find a similar problem, let's consider a scenario involving a high-performance online retail system that needs to process orders in real-time. The analogous problem could be: "How should I architect a distributed system for processing online orders that needs to handle 5,000 orders per second, maintain ACID compliance, and have a recovery time of less than 3 minutes in case of failure?"

Step 2: Solution of the analogous problem:
To solve this analogous problem:
1. **Scalability**: Use a microservices architecture to allow independent scaling of different components (e.g., order processing, inventory management).
2. **Database**: Implement a distributed database that supports ACID transactions, such as CockroachDB or Google Spanner, to ensure data consistency and reliability.
3. **Message Queue**: Utilize a message queue (e.g., Apache Kafka) to handle incoming orders and decouple the order processing from the user interface, allowing for asynchronous processing.
4. **Load Balancing**: Deploy load balancers to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple instances of the order processing service.
5. **Failover Mechanism**: Implement a failover mechanism with automated backups and replication to ensure quick recovery. Use a monitoring system to detect failures and trigger recovery processes.
6. **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct load testing to ensure the system can handle peak loads and optimize performance based on the results.

Step 3: Transfer of solution strategy:
Now I can apply the same strategy to our original problem about processing financial transactions:
1. **Scalability**: Use a microservices architecture to allow independent scaling of components like transaction processing, fraud detection, and reporting.
2. **Database**: Implement a distributed database that supports ACID transactions, such as Amazon Aurora or PostgreSQL with logical replication, to ensure data integrity and compliance.
3. **Message Queue**: Utilize a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Apache Pulsar) to handle incoming transactions and decouple processing from the transaction submission interface.
4. **Load Balancing**: Deploy load balancers to distribute incoming transaction requests evenly across multiple instances of the transaction processing service.
5. **Failover Mechanism**: Implement a failover mechanism with automated backups and replication to ensure recovery within the required time frame. Use a monitoring system to detect failures and trigger recovery processes.
6. **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct load testing to ensure the system can handle 10,000 transactions per second and optimize performance based on the results.

Step 4: The architecture for processing real-time financial transactions should include a microservices architecture, a distributed ACID-compliant database, a message queue for decoupling, load balancing for scalability, a robust failover mechanism for quick recovery, and thorough testing to ensure it can handle 10,000 transactions per second with a recovery time of less than 5 minutes.
