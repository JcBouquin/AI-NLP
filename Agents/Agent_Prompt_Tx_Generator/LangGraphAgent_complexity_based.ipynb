    "    Generate Complexity-based Prompting for complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Complexity-based Prompting is an advanced form of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that focuses on complex examples and prioritizes more elaborate reasoning chains. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    This technique significantly improves performance on mathematical and complex reasoning tasks by:\n",
    "    1. Selecting and analyzing complex examples that require multiple reasoning steps\n",
    "    2. Generating thorough reasoning chains that explore the problem space comprehensively\n",
    "    3. Prioritizing more detailed explanations, under the premise that longer reasoning indicates higher quality answers\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Complexity-based Prompting process includes the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Problem complexity assessment: Evaluate the complexity of the problem based on length, required reasoning steps, and conceptual depth.\n",
    "    2. Detailed reasoning chain: Develop an extensive, step-by-step reasoning process that thoroughly addresses all components of the problem.\n",
    "    3. Alternative pathway consideration: Consider multiple approaches or solution paths to verify the answer.\n",
    "    4. Final answer with justification: Provide a final answer with clear justification based on the most reliable reasoning chain.\n",

    "    Example:\n",
    "    Question: \"A delivery company charges $10 for the first kg and $7 for each additional kg. If a package costs $80 to ship, how many kg does it weigh?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 1: Problem complexity assessment:\n",
    "    This is a multi-step algebraic word problem that requires:\n",
    "    - Understanding the pricing structure (different rates for first vs. additional kg)\n",
    "    - Setting up and solving an equation with variables\n",
    "    - Checking if the solution makes sense in the context\n",
    "    This problem has moderate complexity requiring at least 3-4 distinct reasoning steps.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 2: Detailed reasoning chain:\n",
    "    Let me denote the total weight as x kg.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Given information:\n",
    "    - First kg costs $10\n",
    "    - Each additional kg costs $7\n",
    "    - Total shipping cost is $80\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Let's set up an equation:\n",
    "    - For x kg, we have 1 kg at $10 and (x-1) kg at $7 each\n",
    "    - This gives us: 10 + 7(x-1) = 80\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Let's solve this equation:\n",
    "    - 10 + 7x - 7 = 80\n",
    "    - 7x + 3 = 80\n",
    "    - 7x = 77\n",
    "    - x = 77/7 = 11\n",
    "    \n",
    "    So according to this calculation, the package weighs 11 kg.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 3: Alternative pathway consideration:\n",
    "    Let me verify this result by calculating the cost for an 11 kg package:\n",
    "    - First kg: $10\n",
    "    - Additional 10 kg: 10 × $7 = $70\n",
    "    - Total: $10 + $70 = $80\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This matches our given cost of $80.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Let me also consider a different approach:\n",
    "    - If the package weighed x kg, then the cost would be: 10 + 7(x-1)\n",
    "    - We can rewrite this as: 10 + 7x - 7 = 3 + 7x\n",
    "    - Setting this equal to $80: 3 + 7x = 80\n",
    "    - Subtracting 3: 7x = 77\n",
    "    - Dividing by 7: x = 11\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Both approaches yield the same result, confirming our answer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 4: The package weighs 11 kg. This answer is justified because:\n",
    "    - The mathematical equation 10 + 7(x-1) = 80 yields x = 11\n",
    "    - Verification shows that an 11 kg package would indeed cost $80 ($10 for the first kg plus $70 for the remaining 10 kg)\n",

      "Réponse:\n",
      "Step 1: Problem complexity assessment:\n",
      "The problem of finding the kth smallest element in an unsorted array of n distinct integers is a selection problem that can be solved efficiently. The complexity arises from the need to partition the array and recursively narrow down the search space. The expected time complexity is O(n) due to the use of the Quickselect algorithm, which is based on the partitioning method of QuickSort. The problem requires understanding of:\n",

      "- Partitioning logic\n",

      "To find the kth smallest element using the Quickselect algorithm, we can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Choose a Pivot**: Randomly select a pivot element from the array. This pivot will help partition the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array such that all elements less than the pivot come before it and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. This can be done in linear time. After partitioning, we will have:\n",
      "   - Elements less than the pivot\n",
      "   - The pivot itself\n",
      "   - Elements greater than the pivot\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Determine the Position**: After partitioning, check the position of the pivot:\n",
      "   - If the pivot's position is equal to k-1, then the pivot is the kth smallest element.\n",

      "   - If the pivot's position is less than k-1, recursively apply the Quickselect algorithm to the right subarray (elements greater than the pivot), adjusting k accordingly.\n",

      "4. **Determine the Position**:\n",
      "   - The pivot's position (4) is equal to k-1 (3), so we have found our kth smallest element.\n",

      "- The Quickselect algorithm correctly identified the pivot and partitioned the array, leading to the correct position for k=4.\n",
      "- The verification through sorting confirms that the 4th smallest element is indeed 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Complexity: The expected time complexity of the Quickselect algorithm is O(n) due to the partitioning step, which is linear. The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), but this is rare with a good pivot selection strategy.\n",
