=== QUESTION ===

You're considering two investment options for your $10,000 savings. Option A offers 5% simple interest annually for 3 years. Option B offers 4.5% compound interest annually for 3 years. Which option will provide you with more money at the end of the 3-year period?

=== FINAL ANSWER (STEP 5) ===

The correct answer is that Option A provides $11,500, while Option B provides approximately $11,407.30. Therefore, Option A is the better investment. This conclusion is justified because the calculations for both options were performed correctly, and the accurate value of compound interest was used to compare the two options effectively.

Step 1: Problem understanding:
I need to compare two investment options for my $10,000 savings over a 3-year period. Option A offers 5% simple interest annually, while Option B offers 4.5% compound interest annually. I need to calculate the total amount of money I will have at the end of 3 years for both options and determine which one is better.

Step 2: Incorrect reasoning path:
Let's calculate the total amount for Option A first. The formula for simple interest is:
Total Amount = Principal + (Principal × Rate × Time)
So, for Option A:
Total Amount = $10,000 + ($10,000 × 0.05 × 3) = $10,000 + $1,500 = $11,500.

Now for Option B, I will use the compound interest formula:
Total Amount = Principal × (1 + Rate)^Time
Total Amount = $10,000 × (1 + 0.045)^3 = $10,000 × (1.045)^3.
Calculating (1.045)^3 gives approximately 1.1407, so:
Total Amount = $10,000 × 1.1407 = $11,407.

Now, comparing the two amounts, $11,500 (Option A) is greater than $11,407 (Option B), so I conclude that Option A is better.

Step 3: Error identification:
The error in the reasoning for Option B lies in the calculation of (1.045)^3. The value was approximated incorrectly. The correct calculation should be done more accurately to ensure the result is precise. This could lead to an incorrect conclusion about which investment is better.

Step 4: Correct reasoning path:
Let's calculate the total amount for both options correctly.

For Option A (simple interest):
Total Amount = Principal + (Principal × Rate × Time)
Total Amount = $10,000 + ($10,000 × 0.05 × 3)
Total Amount = $10,000 + ($10,000 × 0.15) = $10,000 + $1,500 = $11,500.

For Option B (compound interest):
Total Amount = Principal × (1 + Rate)^Time
Total Amount = $10,000 × (1 + 0.045)^3
Calculating (1.045)^3 accurately:
(1.045)^3 = 1.14073 (approximately).
Total Amount = $10,000 × 1.14073 = $11,407.30.

Step 5: The correct answer is that Option A provides $11,500, while Option B provides approximately $11,407.30. Therefore, Option A is the better investment. This conclusion is justified because the calculations for both options were performed correctly, and the accurate value of compound interest was used to compare the two options effectively.
