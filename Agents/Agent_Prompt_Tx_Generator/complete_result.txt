=== FINAL RESULT (SUMMARY) ===

QUESTION:
How should I architect a distributed system for processing real-time financial transactions that needs to handle 10,000 transactions per second, maintain ACID compliance, and have a recovery time of less than 5 minutes in case of failure?

FINAL ANSWER (STEP 4):

Step 3: Transfer of solution strategy:
Now I can apply the same strategy to our original problem about processing financial transactions:
1. I would also use a microservices architecture to separate functionalities such as transaction processing, fraud detection, and reporting.
2. Implementing a message queue (like Kafka) would help manage the 10,000 transactions per second by allowing asynchronous processing and scaling.
3. For ACID compliance, I would choose a relational database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) with strong transaction support to ensure that all financial transactions are processed reliably.
4. To meet the recovery time requirement of less than 5 minutes, I would set up a robust backup and failover system, possibly using a hot standby database that can quickly take over in case of a failure.
5. Continuous monitoring and alerting would be essential to maintain system health and performance.

Step 4: To architect a distributed system for processing real-time financial transactions that can handle 10,000 transactions per second, maintain ACID compliance, and ensure a recovery time of less than 5 minutes, I recommend using a microservices architecture, implementing a message queue for asynchronous processing, utilizing a relational database for transaction integrity, and establishing a hot standby database for quick recovery. Additionally, continuous monitoring will help maintain system performance and reliability.


=== COMPLETE PROCESSING (ALL STEPS) ===

Step 1: Analogous problem identification:
This problem involves designing a robust system that can handle high throughput while ensuring data integrity and quick recovery. An analogous problem could be: "How should I architect a distributed system for processing online orders for an e-commerce platform that needs to handle 5,000 orders per minute, maintain ACID compliance, and have a recovery time of less than 3 minutes in case of failure?"

Step 2: Solution of the analogous problem:
To solve this analogous problem:
1. First, I would consider using a microservices architecture to separate different functionalities (e.g., order processing, inventory management, payment processing).
2. I would implement a message queue (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) to handle incoming orders asynchronously, allowing the system to scale and manage spikes in order volume.
3. For ACID compliance, I would use a relational database (like PostgreSQL) with proper transaction management to ensure data integrity.
4. To achieve a recovery time of less than 3 minutes, I would implement regular backups and use a failover strategy with a hot standby database that can take over in case of failure.
5. Finally, I would monitor the system with tools like Prometheus and Grafana to ensure performance and quickly identify issues.
