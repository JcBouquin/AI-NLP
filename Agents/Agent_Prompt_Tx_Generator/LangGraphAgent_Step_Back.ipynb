    "    Step-Back Prompting is a modification of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) where the LLM is first asked to consider high-level concepts or principles before delving into detailed reasoning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This technique significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks by encouraging the model to first understand the broader context and applicable principles before addressing specific details.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Step-Back process includes the following steps:\n",
    "    1. High-level abstraction: First, identify the general principles, concepts, or frameworks that are relevant to the question.\n",
    "    2. Conceptual analysis: Explore how these high-level concepts apply to the specific problem.\n",
    "    3. Detailed reasoning: Once the conceptual framework is established, work through the specific problem step by step.\n",

    "    Step 1: High-level concepts and principles:\n",
    "    Before diving into calculations, let me consider the key concepts involved in this problem:\n",
    "    - Percentage discounts: When an item is discounted by X%, we multiply the price by (100%-X%) or (1-X/100)\n",
    "    - Sales tax: Tax is applied after discounts, and we add X% tax by multiplying by (100%+X%) or (1+X/100)\n",
    "    - Order of operations: In retail pricing, discounts are applied first, then tax is calculated on the discounted amount\n",

    "    Step 2: Application of these concepts:\n",
    "    For this specific problem:\n",
    "    - We need to apply a 25% discount to the original price of $80\n",

    "    Step 3: Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
    "    1. Calculate the discounted price:\n",
    "       - Original price = $80\n",
    "       - Discount rate = 25% = 0.25\n",
    "       - Discount amount = $80 × 0.25 = $20\n",
    "       - Discounted price = $80 - $20 = $60\n",
    "       - Alternatively: Discounted price = $80 × (1 - 0.25) = $80 × 0.75 = $60\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Calculate the tax on the discounted price:\n",
    "       - Discounted price = $60\n",
    "       - Tax rate = 7% = 0.07\n",
    "       - Tax amount = $60 × 0.07 = $4.20\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Calculate the final price:\n",
    "       - Final price = Discounted price + Tax amount\n",
    "       - Final price = $60 + $4.20 = $64.20\n",
    "    \n",

      "\n",
      "Réponse:\n",
      "Step 1: High-level concepts and principles:\n",
      "- Labor Market Dynamics: The relationship between supply and demand for labor, where wages are determined by the equilibrium between employers' willingness to pay and workers' willingness to work.\n",
      "- Minimum Wage Legislation: Government-imposed minimum wage laws that set the lowest legal wage that can be paid to workers.\n",
      "- Elasticity of Labor Demand: The responsiveness of employers to changes in wage rates; if demand for labor is elastic, a rise in wages may lead to a significant reduction in the number of workers hired.\n",
      "- Economic Conditions: The overall state of the economy, including factors like unemployment rates, inflation, and business cycles, which can influence the impact of minimum wage increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Application of these concepts:\n",
      "In this context, an increase in the minimum wage can lead to higher unemployment under certain conditions:\n",
      "- If the demand for labor is elastic, employers may reduce hiring or lay off workers in response to higher wage costs.\n",
      "- In a weak economy with high unemployment, businesses may struggle to absorb increased labor costs, leading to job losses.\n",
      "- Conversely, in a strong economy with low unemployment, businesses may be more willing to accept higher wages, potentially minimizing the negative impact on employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "1. Analyze the impact of a minimum wage increase on labor costs:\n",
      "   - Higher minimum wages increase the cost of hiring workers for employers.\n",
      "   - If employers cannot pass these costs onto consumers through higher prices, they may reduce their workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider the elasticity of labor demand:\n",
      "   - In industries with high competition and low profit margins, employers may be more sensitive to wage increases, leading to layoffs or reduced hiring.\n",
      "   - In contrast, industries with inelastic demand for labor (e.g., essential services) may not reduce employment significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Evaluate the economic context:\n",
      "   - In a recession or economic downturn, businesses may already be operating at reduced capacity, making it difficult to absorb higher wages without cutting jobs.\n",
      "   - In a booming economy, businesses may have more flexibility to raise wages without significant layoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Explore potential mitigating factors:\n",
      "   - If the minimum wage increase leads to higher consumer spending (due to increased worker income), it could stimulate demand for goods and services, potentially offsetting job losses.\n",
      "   - Policies such as tax credits for employers or phased-in wage increases can help minimize the negative impact on employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: An increase in the minimum wage can lead to higher unemployment primarily when labor demand is elastic and economic conditions are weak. However, this effect may be minimized or reversed in a strong economy, where businesses can absorb higher wages, or through policies that support both workers and employers, such as tax incentives or gradual wage increases.\n"
