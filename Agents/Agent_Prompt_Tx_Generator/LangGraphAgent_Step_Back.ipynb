    "    Generate Step-Back Prompting based on user questions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step-Back Prompting is a modification of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) where the LLM is first asked to consider high-level concepts or principles before delving into detailed reasoning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This technique significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks by encouraging the model to first understand the broader context and applicable principles before addressing specific details.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Step-Back process includes the following steps:\n",
    "    1. High-level abstraction: First, identify the general principles, concepts, or frameworks that are relevant to the question.\n",
    "    2. Conceptual analysis: Explore how these high-level concepts apply to the specific problem.\n",
    "    3. Detailed reasoning: Once the conceptual framework is established, work through the specific problem step by step.\n",
    "    4. Answer the original question: Provide a final answer based on the analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Please structure your response in the following format:\n",

    "    Question: \"A store is having a 25% off sale. If an item originally costs $80, what is the final price after the discount and 7% sales tax?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 1: High-level concepts and principles:\n",
    "    Before diving into calculations, let me consider the key concepts involved in this problem:\n",
    "    - Percentage discounts: When an item is discounted by X%, we multiply the price by (100%-X%) or (1-X/100)\n",
    "    - Sales tax: Tax is applied after discounts, and we add X% tax by multiplying by (100%+X%) or (1+X/100)\n",
    "    - Order of operations: In retail pricing, discounts are applied first, then tax is calculated on the discounted amount\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 2: Application of these concepts:\n",
    "    For this specific problem:\n",
    "    - We need to apply a 25% discount to the original price of $80\n",
    "    - Then we need to apply a 7% sales tax to the discounted price\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 3: Step-by-step reasoning:\n",
    "    1. Calculate the discounted price:\n",
    "       - Original price = $80\n",
    "       - Discount rate = 25% = 0.25\n",
    "       - Discount amount = $80 × 0.25 = $20\n",
    "       - Discounted price = $80 - $20 = $60\n",
    "       - Alternatively: Discounted price = $80 × (1 - 0.25) = $80 × 0.75 = $60\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Calculate the tax on the discounted price:\n",
    "       - Discounted price = $60\n",
    "       - Tax rate = 7% = 0.07\n",
    "       - Tax amount = $60 × 0.07 = $4.20\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Calculate the final price:\n",
    "       - Final price = Discounted price + Tax amount\n",
    "       - Final price = $60 + $4.20 = $64.20\n",
    "    \n",
