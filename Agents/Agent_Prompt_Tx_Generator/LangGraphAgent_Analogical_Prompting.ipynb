    "# Analogical Prompting: The Power of Custom Examples to Improve LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogical Prompting, introduced by Yasunaga et al. (2023), is a sophisticated method that extends the concept of In-Context Learning by automatically generating relevant examples enriched with reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does Analogical Prompting Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a teacher who, faced with a student struggling with a complex mathematical problem, would spontaneously present an analogous but simpler example to illustrate the solution method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogical Prompting reproduces this pedagogical approach in two key phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic example generation**: Instead of using predefined examples, the system dynamically generates exemplars analogous to the problem at hand, but with known or more accessible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inclusion of reasoning chains**: Each generated example is accompanied by a complete Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that explicitly details the step-by-step resolution process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Is This Particularly Effective?\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach offers considerable advantages by allowing the model to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Benefit from examples specifically tailored to each problem\n",
    "* Observe reasoning directly applicable to the case being studied\n",
    "* Transfer resolution strategies from an analogous problem to the target problem\n",
    "* Learn by example rather than through abstract instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are particularly impressive in:\n",
    "* Complex mathematical reasoning\n",
    "* Code generation\n",
    "* Problem-solving requiring structured approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like having a tutor who, for each new challenge, would first show you how to solve a similar problem before letting you try.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is similar to the SG-ICL (Self-Generated In-Context Learning) approach, but distinguishes itself by focusing on generating specifically analogous examples and the systematic inclusion of detailed reasoning chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next time you use AI to solve a complex problem, you might indirectly benefit from this ability to draw inspiration from automatically generated analogous examples!"

    "    Analogical Prompting is a technique within Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that automatically generates exemplars with reasoning paths by drawing analogies between the current problem and similar problems. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    This technique significantly improves performance on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks by leveraging the power of analogical thinking and transferring problem-solving strategies from familiar domains to new ones.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Analogical Prompting process includes the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Identify a similar problem: Find or create an analogous problem that shares structural similarities with the current problem.\n",
    "    2. Solve the analogous problem: Work through the analogous problem step by step, showing the complete reasoning path.\n",
    "    3. Transfer the solution strategy: Apply the same reasoning pattern from the analogous problem to the current problem.\n",
    "    4. Answer the original question: Provide a final answer based on the transferred reasoning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Please structure your response in the following format:\n",

    "    This problem involves multiplication across multiple levels of organization. Let me consider an analogous problem:\n",
    "    \"A school has 15 classrooms with 20 desks per classroom. If each desk has 2 drawers, how many total drawers are there in the school?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 2: Solution of the analogous problem:\n",
    "    To solve this analogous problem:\n",
    "    1. First, I need to find the total number of desks: 15 classrooms × 20 desks per classroom = 300 desks\n",
    "    2. Then, I need to find the total number of drawers: 300 desks × 2 drawers per desk = 600 drawers\n",

    "    Step 3: Transfer of solution strategy:\n",
