    "    Generate Analogical Prompting based on user questions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Analogical Prompting is a technique within Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that automatically generates exemplars with reasoning paths by drawing analogies between the current problem and similar problems. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    This technique significantly improves performance on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks by leveraging the power of analogical thinking and transferring problem-solving strategies from familiar domains to new ones.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Analogical Prompting process includes the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Identify a similar problem: Find or create an analogous problem that shares structural similarities with the current problem.\n",
    "    2. Solve the analogous problem: Work through the analogous problem step by step, showing the complete reasoning path.\n",
    "    3. Transfer the solution strategy: Apply the same reasoning pattern from the analogous problem to the current problem.\n",
    "    4. Answer the original question: Provide a final answer based on the transferred reasoning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Please structure your response in the following format:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 1: [Analogous problem identification]\n",
    "    Step 2: [Solution of the analogous problem]\n",
    "    Step 3: [Transfer of solution strategy]\n",
    "    Step 4: [Final Answer]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Question: \"A warehouse has 25 rows of shelves with 12 boxes per shelf. If each box contains 8 items, how many total items are in the warehouse?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 1: Analogous problem identification:\n",
    "    This problem involves multiplication across multiple levels of organization. Let me consider an analogous problem:\n",
    "    \"A school has 15 classrooms with 20 desks per classroom. If each desk has 2 drawers, how many total drawers are there in the school?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 2: Solution of the analogous problem:\n",
    "    To solve this analogous problem:\n",
    "    1. First, I need to find the total number of desks: 15 classrooms × 20 desks per classroom = 300 desks\n",
    "    2. Then, I need to find the total number of drawers: 300 desks × 2 drawers per desk = 600 drawers\n",
    "    So the school has a total of 600 drawers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 3: Transfer of solution strategy:\n",
    "    Now I can apply the same strategy to our original problem about the warehouse:\n",
    "    1. First, I need to find the total number of boxes: 25 rows × 12 boxes per shelf = 300 boxes\n",
    "    2. Then, I need to find the total number of items: 300 boxes × 8 items per box = 2,400 items\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 4: The warehouse contains a total of 2,400 items.\n",
