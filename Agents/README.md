# AI Agents Exploration

This repository contains implementations and examples of AI agents using two different frameworks:

## ðŸ¤– CrewAI
Exploration of multi-agent systems where agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks.
- Agent-based task decomposition
- Role-based agent specialization
- Tools integration (Trello, data analysis)
- Sequential and parallel agent workflows

## ðŸ”„ LangGraph
Implementation of state management and workflow control for Language Models.
- State management with TypedDict
- Data filtering and processing workflows
- Interactive chat systems
- Sequential processing pipelines
